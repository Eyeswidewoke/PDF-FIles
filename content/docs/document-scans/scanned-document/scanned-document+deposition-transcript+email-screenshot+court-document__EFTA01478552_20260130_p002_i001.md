Subject: a few things - Weekly pipeline, focuses and quick update [I] 
Classification: For internal use only 
Dario, Haig and Chip, 
So you have it - here is an example of the weekly pipeline, themes and focuses 
we go through each week (recently instituted :-) ). This is a good way to 
have a sense of 1. Assessing client opportunities (and likelihood of rev. and 
close) 2. Creates accountability and focus and 3. Allows us to idea share and 
leverage across the team, client base etc. 
Can send it to you weekly if helpful. Also, we will have monthly packet where 
we will have 'recent closes' added to it as well as revenue numbers, % change 
YOY, t vs. target etc.

Also, from a deal and client perspective a few updates: 
1. Very good meetings from Luis's trip to Brazil, see summary in packet. 13 
meetings w/ a lot of follow-up. Raph and team have been making good progress 
getting in front of bankers. Now its about closing accounts, and being able to 
properly cover them - from a support and infrastructure perspective. Work in 
progress. 
2. Tazia has been involved in a number of new pitches and client 
opportunities, new KCP on-boarding - see pipeline. Work in progress. 
3. Private transactions: Raph is driving Ritz real estate deal, which we 
finally got over some internal compliance/legal hurdles (all on board) but we 
need to fix process which I'm working on. $30mm of soft demand in LatAm, one 
client $90mm out of US but nothing confirmed yet - will continue to garner 
interest here in US to see if we can move to next stage of being involved in 
deal. Dario this should fall into the Private markets process you were 
highlighting last week - we have a call w/ Taroun on Wed to review for future 
business. 
4. Have been meeting many bankers and PCS folks and spending time networking 
internally. Its been taking up alot of time, so trying to manage across the 
next couple months. 
5. Have been out with some of the bankers meeting a number of clients: J. 
Epstein (Morris), G. Mosko (Sohrab), Lazari/Mathis (Sohrab), T. Volah 
(Ahdieh) ; 
Also on my list and setting up time w/ Tisch Family (Morris), Carl 
Icahn (Rosemary), David Zalaznick (Stepania), Mort Zuckerman (Jenssen), 
Jospehine Linden (Morris). 
6. I will be having a team meeting with the group on Thursday to review -
Team: update and desk strategy, structure/seat change, key responsibilities 
and oversight; Global 8 Regional Project List, YTD Business update and 2014+, 
Desk Roll out strategy and 2014+. In terms of structure, see attached, will 
send you materials if you'd like to see them on Wed. Let me know.

A lot more work to do from a team, infrastructure and business perspective, 
but wanted to give you quick updates as I can... 
Kind regards, 
Caroline
