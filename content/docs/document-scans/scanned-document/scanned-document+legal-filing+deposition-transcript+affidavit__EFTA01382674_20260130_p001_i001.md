We Have a Global Footprint Enabling Us to Reach Clients Around the World 
We have operations in 36 countries and serve clients in 118 countries around the world directly and indirectly. We have well-established 
businesses and partnerships to serve clients in large developed economies such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia 
where the penetration of electronic payments is high and the use of commerce-enabling technologies is common. 
We have also made strategic investments and developed key partnerships in fast-growing emerging markets where the penetration of 
electronic payments is lower. For example. in India. we have a merchant acquiring joint venture with ICICIL the country's largest private-sector 
bank, and in Brazil, we serve various financial institutions with our CisionPLUS software and established a new merchant acquiring business. 
named Bin, in 2014. 
We believe our global breadth is an increasing competitive advantage as multi-national organizations, such as retailers, restaurant 
chains, and financial institutions, want to work with a single trusted technology partner across multiple geographies to deploy various solutions. We 
also engage local business and financial institution clients around the world who are seeking to adopt next-generation solutions from a global leader 
in electronic commerce, rather than the often less-advanced offerings of local competitors. 
Our Broad-Based Client Service Capabilities Differentiate Us 
Most clients view their payments systens as mission-critical infrastructure for their businesses. In addition. our clients around the world 
are also facing increasing operating complexity due to new technologies, such as mobile payments. and the implementation of new regulations and 
standards, such as the ElvIV liability shift in the United States beginning in October 2015. Our ability to provide our clients with broad-based client 
service is a major competitive advantage, especially against emerging companies that often lack deep client service capabilities. 
We Have Powerful, Proprietary Technology Platforms 
We own and operate proprietary technology platforms which give us a wide range of capabilities that distinguish First Data in the global 
marketplace and provide us with significant competitive advantages. Our powerful technology platforms are strategically positioned around the 
world to meet the different technical needs of our large, diversified client base and support our global operations. We also offer clients significant 
choice in how we deploy these platforms, including through end-to-end outsourcing. licensing of our technolo&v, providing managed services, and 
offering software-as-a-service. These platforms enable us to provide a best-in-class suite of commerce-enabling solutions, in a large number of 
different markets, with a varied set of regulatory requirements. across multiple sales channels. 
Our technology platforms provide a range of functions, including: (I) hosting and management of our proprietary software solutions and 
our cloud-based business applications; (2) end-to-end processing of our clients' commercial transactions. including front-end functions to facilitate 
the capture and authorization of payment transactions, the network connectivity services to route certain types of transactions, and the back-end 
functions to facilitate clearing and settlement of funds: (3) risk management functions to help prevent and detect fraud and the security functions to 
protect our clients' data: and (4) data management functions to help our clients organize. analyze. and synthesize data. 
We develop and maintain our platforms in-house, which enables us to ensure they arc highly stable, secure, and scalable with substantial 
excess capacity to expand our capabilities without the need for material new investment. This allows us to improve operating margins as we add 
incremental processing volumes and launch new technologies to address emerging opportunities in a rapidly changing market.
