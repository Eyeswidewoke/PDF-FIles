use of institutional customer order information by Merrill Lynch's traders was improper and contrary to 
Merrill Lynch's confidentiality representations to its customers. The 2011 Order also found instances

agreed to charge the customer only a commission equivalent fee. The 2011 Order found that, in doing so, 
Merrill Lynch acted improperly and contrary to its agreement with its customers. The 2011 Order also

agreements with institutional customers to guarantee an execution price, which agreements were part of

conduct, Merrill Lynch willfully violated Section 15(c)(1)(A) of the Exchange Ad by effecting transactions 
in securities by means of manipulative, deceptive or other fraudulent devices or contrivances, and willfully 
violated Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act by failing to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information. The 2011 
Order also found that under section 15(b)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act, Merrill Lynch failed reasonably to 
supervise its traders with a view towards preventing them from violating the federal securities laws. The 
2011 Order also found that Merrill Lynch willfully violated section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 
17a-3(A)(6) thereunder by failing to record certain terms and conditions of customer orders. Merrill Lynch 
neither admitted nor denied the findings in the order. The findings in the 2011 Order are not binding on 
any person or entity other than Merrill Lynch.

3(A)(6) thereunder, (2) censured Merrill Lynch pursuant to Section 15(b)(4) of the Exchange Act; and (3)
