2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40263, * 
"In this diversity case, Ohio law determines the elements of damages [that] plaintiffs must 
prove, and the quantum and type of evidence necessary to prove them." Anchor v. 
O'Toole, 94 F.3d 1014, 1020 (6th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). To establish a breach of 
contract claim in Ohio, a plaintiff must prove the existence of a contract, performance by 
the plaintiff, breach by the defendant, and damage or loss to the plaintiff. Savedoff v. 
Access Grp., 524 F.3d 754, 762 (6th Cir. 2008). "Damages are an essential element of a 
breach of contract claim." Oak Rubber Co. v. Bank One, N.A., 214 F. Supp. 2d 820, 831 
(N.D. Ohio 2002) (granting summary judgment on breach of contract claim where there 
was no evidence of damages) (citing Doner v. Snapp. 98 Ohio App. 3d 597, 600-01, 649 
N.E.2d 42 (Ohio Ct. App. 1994); Anchor, 94 F.3d at 1020 (6th Cir. 1996)). Once 
challenged on summary judgment, a plaintiff must come forward with competent, credible 
evidence to create a question of fact as to the existence of damages. C26] Bemmes v. 
Public Emps. Ret. Sys., 102 Ohio App. 3d 782, 789-90, 658 N.E.2d 31 (Ohio Ct. App. 
1995). 
As a general rule. an injured party cannot recover damages for breach of contract beyond the amount that is 
established by the evidence with reasonable certainty. and generally. courts have required greater certainty in the proof 
of damages for breach of contract than in tort. . . . The damages awarded for a breach of contract should place the 
injured party in as good a position as it would have been in but for the breach. Such compensatory damages. often 
termed expectation damages, are limited to actual loss. which loss must be established with reasonable certainty. 
Textron Fin. Corp. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 115 Ohio App. 3d 137, 144, 684 N.E.2d 
1261 (Ohio Ct. App. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). See also 
Moriarty v. Equisearch Servs., Inc., 443 F. App'x 64, 66-67 (6th Cir. 2011) (citing Textron, 
115 Ohio App. 3d at 137, and affirming district court's grant of summary judgment where 
plaintiff failed to prove damages). 
To successfully assert a claim for lost profits, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the profits were within the contemplation 
of the parties at the time of execution, that the ['27] loss of profits is the reasonable result of the breach. and that the 
profits are not remote and speculative. . . . There must be more than a conclusory statement as to the amount of lost 
profits. An explanation of how that sum was determined is required. Lost profits must be substantiated by calculations 
based on facts available or in evidencer.] otherwise they are speculative and uncertain. 
Textron, 115 Ohio App. 3d at 146 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
Here, plaintiffs' proof of damages rests entirely on the affidavits of Loadman and Coco, 
which, as discussed in the Court's ruling on defendant's objections thereto (see 
Memorandum Opinion and Order at Doc. No. 64), must, in relevant part, be disregarded on 
summary judgment as speculative, not based on personal knowledge, not based on 
evidence in the record, inadmissible hearsay, and improper lay opinion testimony. 
Moreover, the memo presented as an exhibit to Coco's affidavit—prepared in large part by 
Kozak—contains various charts, graphs, and figures, but does not state the equity value of 
Allred Metal, nor do plaintiffs offer deposition or affidavit testimony from Kozak, or any 
other admissible evidence, to explain 
28] the purpose of the memo or otherwise explain 
the calculations contained therein. Further, the memo is admittedly a summary of 
information obtained from third party source documents not in the record. Consequently, 
any calculations derived therefrom are merely speculative. See JGR, Inc. v. Thomasville 
Furniture Indus., Inc., 370 F.3d 519, 525 (6th Cir. 2004). Accordingly, because plaintiff has 
failed to offer sufficient admissible evidence showing damages resulting from the alleged 
breaches of contract, such as the value of Allred Metal to Loadman or the amount of profit 
he expected to earn at closing, Banco is entitled to summary judgment as to plaintiffs'
