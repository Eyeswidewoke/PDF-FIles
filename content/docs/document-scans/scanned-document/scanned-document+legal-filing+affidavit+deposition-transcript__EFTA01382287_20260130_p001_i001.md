Amendment No. 3 to Form S-I 
Table of Contents 
If a substantial number of shares becomes available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our 
common stock could decline. 
If our Existing Owners sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market following this offering, the market price of 
our common stock could decrease. The perception in the public market that our Existing Owners might sell shares of common stock 
could also create a perceived overhang and depress our market price. Upon completion of this offering, we will have 475,139,081 shares 
of common stock outstanding of which 409,832,959 shares will be held by our current stockholders. Prior to this offering, we and our 
Existing Owners will have agreed with the underwriters to a lock-up" period, meaning that such parties may not, subject to certain 
exceptions, sell any of their existing shares of our common stock without the prior written consent of representatives of the underwriters 
for at least 180 days after the date of this prospectus. Pursuant to this agreement, among other exceptions, we may enter into an 
agreement providing for the issuance of our common stock in connection with the acquisition, merger or joint venture with another 
publicly traded entity during the 180-day restricted period after the date of this prospectus. In addition, all of our Existing Owners will be 
subject to the holding period requirement of Rule 144 ("Rule 144") under the Securities Act, as described in "Shares Eligible for Future 
Sale." When the lock-up agreements expire, these shares will become eligible for sale, in some cases subject to the requirements of 
Rule 144. 
In addition, the Cerberus-led Consortium, through Albertsons Investor, will have substantial demand and incidental registration 
rights, as described in "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Stockholders' Agreement." The market price for shares of 
our common stock may drop when the restrictions on resale by our Existing Owners lapse. We intend to file one or more registration 
statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable 
for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our 2015 Equity and Incentive Award Plan (the "2015 Incentive Plan") and our 
Restricted Stock Unit Plan (the "Restricted Stock Unit Plan"). Any such Form S-8 registration statements will automatically become 
effective upon filing. Accordingly, shares registered under such registration statements will be available for sale in the open market. We 
expect that the initial registration statement on Form S-8 will cover 7.3% of the shares of our common stock. A decline in the market 
price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or 
other equity securities. 
If equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or 
downgrade our common shares, the market price of our common stock could decline. 
The trading market for our common shares likely will be influenced by the research and reports that equity and debt research 
analysts publish about the industry, us and our business. The market price of our common stock could decline if one or more securities 
analysts downgrade our shares or if those analysts issue a sell recommendation or other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing 
reports about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our shares, the market price of our 
common stock would likely decline. 
Because we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you 
sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. 
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and our stockholders will not be guaranteed, or have contractual or 
other rights, to receive dividends. Our board of directors may, in its discretion, modify or repeal our dividend policy. The declaration and 
payment of dividends depends on various factors, including: our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and 
other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
