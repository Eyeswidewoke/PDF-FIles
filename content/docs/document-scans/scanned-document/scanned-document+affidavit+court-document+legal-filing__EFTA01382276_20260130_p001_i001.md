Amendment No. 3 to Form S-I 
Table of Contents 
We may be adversely affected by risks related to our dependence on IT systems. Any future intrusion into these IT systems, 
even if we are compliant with industry security standards, could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition 
and operating results. 
We have complex IT systems that are important to the success of our business operations and marketing initiatives. If we were to 
experience failures, breakdowns, substandard performance or other adverse events affecting these systems, or difficulties accessing the 
proprietary business data stored in these systems, or in maintaining, expanding or upgrading existing systems or implementing new 
systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our systems and business. 
Our ability to effectively manage the day-to-day business of approximately 900 Albertsons and NAI stores depends significantly on 
IT services and systems provided by SuperValu pursuant to two transition services agreements (the "SVU TSAs"). It is intended that 
SuperValu will also provide IT services and systems for the stores Acme Markets acquires pursuant to the ASP Transaction. Prior to 
Albertsons' and NAI's transition onto Safeway's IT systems, the failure of SuperValu's systems to operate effectively or to integrate with 
other systems, or unauthorized access into SuperValu's systems, could cause us to incur significant losses due to disruptions in our 
systems and business. 
We receive and store personal information in connection with our marketing and human resources organizations. The protection of 
our customer and employee data is critically important to us. Despite our considerable efforts to secure our respective computer 
networks, security could be compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur, as has 
occurred with a number of other retailers. If we (or through SuperValu) experience a data security breach, we could be exposed to 
government enforcement actions, possible assessments from the card brands if credit card data was involved and potential litigation. In 
addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to stop 
shopping at our stores altogether. The loss of confidence from a data security breach involving our employees could hurt our reputation 
and cause employee recruiting and retention challenges. 
Improper activities by third parties, exploitation of encryption technology, new data-hacking tools and discoveries and other events 
or developments may result in future intrusions into or compromise of our networks, payment card terminals or other payment systems. 
In particular, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often cannot be 
recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, we may not be able to anticipate these frequently changing techniques or 
implement adequate preventive measures for all of them. Any unauthorized access into our customers' sensitive information, or data 
belonging to us or our suppliers, even if we are compliant with industry security standards, could put us at a competitive disadvantage. 
result in deterioration of our customers' confidence in us. and subject us to potential litigation, liability, fines and penalties and consent 
decrees, resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
As merchants who accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry ("PCI") Data Security 
Standard (-PCI DSS") issued by the PCI Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security 
surrounding the physical administrative and technical storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. By accepting 
debit cards for payment, we are also subject to compliance with American National Standards Institute ("ANSI') data encryption 
standards and payment network security operating guidelines. In addition, we are required to comply with PCI DSS version 3.0 for our 
2015 assessment, and are replacing or enhancing our in-store systems to comply with these standards. Failure to be PCI compliant or to 
meet other payment card standards may result in the imposition of financial penalties or the allocation by the card brands of the costs of 
fraudulent charges to us. Despite our efforts to comply with these or other payment card standards and other information security 
measures, we cannot be certain that all of our (or through SuperValu) IT systems will be able to prevent, contain or detect all
