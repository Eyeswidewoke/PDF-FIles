Hello Jeffrey. 
I was trying to contact you for a long time, it was real=y hard time to me, but I even dont remember when something 
was right in my=life. But , as they say, if nothing goes right, go left, so I started to a=mit things as they are and just dont 
overthink and kill myself. 
I really need to see you, and I was really shy to write you and ask for=something, but I really need your help. 
I want to meet you in=September and I want to get to a new start, I am fed enough with my family= country and 
traditions, feelings, consideration and stuff. That all toget=er pushed me in a small circle and was torturing me every 
day, killing my =elf-appreciation and wiliness to anything. 
I want to be true to you, I dealed with as much problem=s as I could, gained some weight, I was 38 kg ! a month ago, 
stabilized my=sense. But I can not move forward because of money. I was trying to work, =ven when my visa doesnt 
allow me to, but here, in Malaysia its impossible.=l cant make easy money and turn to a wrong way, I was trying to live 
in th=se obstacles, which I was going through. 
But now, Im in a trap, I made my best to push myself to=this line, when I can be as free as a bird and breath some life in 
myself,=or I will miss it and die inside. I cant take it anymore. 
Its very hard for me to ask you money, but I woul= really thankful! if you could help it out, I could do anything that I 
can=for you. 
All I need is just my teeth repair and flight to Par=s, to you. I really need it, and my dream is to make these teeth until! 
Se=tember and work put for looking better and meet you before my new life sta=ts, Its a long way talk, I want to tell it to 
you personally, when we meet= 
The problem is since I moved to Malaysia, you remember = was living hard in Uzbekistan, and they started eat me and 
my parents wit= rumors, as I was a "wrong" girl, they provocated them to arrang= a marriage for me, untill its "too late" 
so I was working as a =onkey for one year and won a competition to move and study here in Malaysi=, I gathered my 
money secretly and just run away, because Malaysia is t=e only place except post Soviet Union countries which dont 
need visa. So I=payed for the half of my studies and moved on with my scholarship, but my =arents dont accept me and 
was really angry and its been 6 month we dont ta=k. 
I was trying to compromise, but no result, I was feelin= pain for it, but now I decided to stop. If we have no point of 
mutual ag=eements and understanding, I dont need it in my life. 
So, since I moved from Uzbekistan, I could not work on my braces, her= its too expensive and I had some time to wear 
them without changing in ad=ance, now, some of them fell out, my teeth are intensively moving in a wro=g way and 
they start to shake because of the wrong spread pressure, I gues= Im about to loose all my teeth so far if I wont do 
anything to them. c/=iv> 
I made a consultation with a dentist, and he said the w=ole work whicj should be done 
- to glue 3 new =races bricks back,
