IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION, INVESTORS MUST RELY ON THEIR OWN 
EXAMINATION OF THE ACCESS FUND AND THE TERMS OF THE OFFERING, INCLUDING THE 
MERITS AND RISKS INVOLVED. THE INTERESTS HAVE NOT BEEN RECOMMENDED BY ANY 
U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY. 
FURTHERMORE, THE FOREGOING AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY 
OR DETERMINED THE ADEQUACY OF THIS MEMORANDUM. ANY REPRESENTATION TO 
THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. 
THIS MEMORANDUM SUPERSEDES ANY AND ALL TERM SHEETS, PITCH BOOKS,

MEMORANDUM TO SUCH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING. 
NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING TO GIVE ANY 
INFORMATION OR TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OTHER THAN AS CONTAINED IN 
THIS MEMORANDUM AND, IF GIVEN OR MADE. SUCH INFORMATION OR REPRESENTATION 
MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE ACCESS FUND, THE 
GENERAL PARTNER, THE INVESTMENT MANAGER, GLENDOWER, OR ANY OF THEIR 
AFFILIATES (OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, 
MEMBERS, PARTNERS, SHAREHOLDERS OR AGENTS). ANY PURCHASE OF INTERESTS 
MADE BY ANY INVESTOR ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION OR REPRESENTATIONS NOT 
CONTAINED HEREIN OR INCONSISTENT HEREWITH SHALL BE SOLELY AT THE RISK OF 
SUCH INVESTOR. 
EACH RECIPIENT OF THIS MEMORANDUM ACKNOWLEDGES THAT PROSPECTIVE LIMITED 
PARTNERS IN THE UNDERLYING FUND HAVE RECEIVED CERTAIN MATERIALS PREPARED 
BY GLENDOWER THAT MAY CONTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE 
UNDERLYING FUND AND ITS PORTFOLIO, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS 
MEMORANDUM. SUCH INFORMATION, HAD IT BEEN PROVIDED TO THE INVESTOR, MAY 
HAVE BEEN MATERIAL TO THE INVESTOR'S DECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO INVEST IN 
THE ACCESS FUND. BY ACCEPTING THIS MEMORANDUM, EACH INVESTOR AGREES TO 
THE FOREGOING. 
THE INTERESTS ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND 
MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE SECURITIES 
ACT AND THE APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR 
EXEMPTION THEREFROM. 
INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE 
REQUIRED TO BEAR THE FINANCIAL RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE 
PERIOD OF TIME. 
EACH HOLDER OF INTERESTS WILL BE REQUIRED UPON REQUEST BY THE GENERAL 
PARTNER TO CERTIFY AS TO THE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SUCH INTERESTS AND ANY 
INTEREST THEREIN IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT THE ASSETS OF THE ACCESS FUND WILL 
NOT BE PLAN ASSETS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 
1974, AS AMENDED. IT IS INTENDED THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INTERESTS THAT MAY 
BE PURCHASED WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF FUNDS MAY BE LIMITED, AND EACH INVESTOR 
WHO BECOMES A LIMITED PARTNER OF THE ACCESS FUND AND ANY SUBSEQUENT 
TRANSFEREE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND CERTIFICATIONS 
REGARDING THE SOURCE OF FUNDS USED TO ACQUIRE THE INTERESTS. 
TO BE 
EFFECTIVE, ALL TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS MUST BE RECORDED IN THE LIST OF 
PARTNERS OF THE ACCESS FUND MAINTAINED BY THE GENERAL PARTNER.
