NEWS 
Lr
ast month the City of Boca Raton passed a 
ew adult entertainment Ordinance along 
rith a dancer licensing Ordinance. While 
the ordinances contain a hodge pods., of pro-
visions that we have seen in numerous other 
ordinances, the circumstances surrounding its 
passage were a lithe bit out of the ordinary. 
For one thing, for three days after these o-di. 
nances were passed, the Palm Beach County 
media kept playing up this story. A day or two 
maybe, but three days may be just a little 
excessive, but maybe not for Boca. 
The real story was not that the city of Boca 
Raton passed adult entertainment ordinances. 
The real story was the fact that the Boca Raton 
City Commission had the opportunity to 
choose from one of two ordinances and the 
reasons and ridiculous rationale that they used 
to chose the one that they did. 
The ordinance that they chose, prohibits 
total nudity, prohibits alcohol where there is 
topless nudity, and requires forms of topless 
nudity in non-alcohol establishments to be rel-
egated to the stage. The other ordinance that 
the City cnose not to pass, would have allowed 
for topless nudity where alcohol was served as 
long as it was confined to an establishment of 
considerable size, that had a full restaurant 
that coulc serve up to 150 meals at a time, and 
would also require valet parking. The differ-
ences oetween these two ordinances were sim-
ple. Tne ordinance that was passed by the 
City of Bova Raton will foster the lower end 
type of establishment, the ones that can sur-
vive without putting in hundreds of thousands 
if not millions of dollars in decor,upgrades, 
ambiance, and of course the kitchen. Rather, 
even after having it explained to them by the 
City Attorney and having one of the larger 
land owners in Boca Raton speak cn behalf of 
the ordinance that was ultimately rejected, the 
City Commission in their wisdom voted the 
otherway. 
It was obvious from anyone sitting there, 
that the City Commission dd not vote for what 
was best for Boca Raton or for the constituents. 
Rather, the councilmen were grandstanding to 
the media. Some of them actually gave their 
little speeches while looking right nto the 
camera. One of them went as far as to start his 
speech as to why he was going to vote the way 
he was, by starting off with he doesn't under-
stand how prisoners in Guantanamo Bay can 
deserve constitutional rights. Then he along 
with all of the other city council people spoke 
to the press by beginning with that they were 
not in favor of adult entertainment in any way 
shape or form and are only vot ng the way they 
arc because they don't understand it, but the 
Constitution requires them to have adult enter-
tainment. 
Not one of the commissioners cared about 
the net results of their vote. They all were just 
scared of appearing to favor or be in favor of 
some type of adult entertainment. 
Well, sometimes you get what you wish for. 
:n the future there will be some adult darting

establishments in Boca Raton. However, 
because of the City's myopic and shortsighted 
deosion, they won't he places of elegance and 
they won't be large financial investments. 
Rather,:hey are going to end up being places 
dim ultimately the Boca Raton City 
Commission was tryingto prevent from coming 
in to their town. 
On another note, by the tine you read this 
article, summary judgment motions are due 
before United States District Court Judge 
Alberto Jordan in the case of the three adult 
bookstores in Miami-Dade County that are 
suing the courty over the doors off booths pol-
icy. The essence of this case, is whether or not 
Miami-Dade County had sufficient evicence to 
show that keeping doors on adult viewing 
booths •n bookstores causes HIV and other sex-
ually transmitted diseases. 
Lastly, and although not exactly local news, 
we are still waiting for the decision in Daytona 
Grand d/b/a Lollipops v. City of Daytona 
Beach. As you recall this is a case involving 
challenges to Daytona Beach's Alcohol Nudity 
Ordinance and General Nudity Ordinance. A 
decisior in this case, could have great impact 
on the adult dancing world in the Eleventh 
Circuit, which covers Georgia, Florida and 
Alabama. 
As always, we encourage other attorneys or 
other people to in:orin us of any adultenter-
tainmert or First Amendment issues that they 
believe that we should pass on to our readers. 
Should you have any news, please let us know.
