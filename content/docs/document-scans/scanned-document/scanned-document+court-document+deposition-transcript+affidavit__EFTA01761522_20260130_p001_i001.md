Ian, 
Ghislaine, of all people, should beware of what is found on the web... 
In any case, that matter was fully and completely resolved a while ago. The=case was fully withdrawn by the plaintiff 
party during the discovery proces=, as they found out that they did not have a case against us at all, and we=e missing 
some important details, like the fact that it was not me who defr=uded them, but their own internal partner. 
We have not had the funds to get the article removed, which requires a lawy=r to go after that site. 
In proper context: 
What you saw was a press release (based on a one-sided Court pleading, not =n any facts, and where you can make any 
sort of assertion). issued after a lawsuit was filed against both myself and Isabel by Ensign Consulting,=a while back 
concerning some very expensive antiquarian books and an origin.' iconic portrait of Sir Isaac Newton that I had 
purchased some time previo=sly. The suit was easily and fully resolved during the discovery period whe= I was able to 
prove beyond any question that one of Ensign's own consultan=s Adam Gold (mentioned in the article) and a former 
friend of Isabel's and rine, secretly and without our knowledge, secured a personal loan for himsel= using my own 
valuable books and possessions as his own collateral! This wa= an amazing thing for us to have found out, as he was a 
friend of ours. 
While I was writing Adam telling him of my my own personal business purchas=s, he secretly told Ensign Consulting (I 
didn't know them or have an= correspondence or dealings with them and neither did Isabel) that these pu=chases were 
his own purchases, and he independently got a six figure person=l loan for himself using my possessions as his collateral, 
completely an= utterly unknown to us. 
When Adam default=d on his loan to Ensign, of course, they went ballistic, and naturally went=after me, as they thought 
I was the one responsible, and had the collateral= Yet, the books that Adam had secretly borrowed against were fully 
paid =or by me, and Adam had not sent any money for them, and the funds that re did send, were sent back. I was able 
to show through bank wire statements= invoices, and correspondence between myself and Adam, that he had not 
purc=ased these books on behalf of Ensign, and that they were entirely my proper=y, and that I could do with them as I 
wished. I also was able to show that = had no knowledge of Ensign or the loan. as I had retained all my correspon=ence 
with Adam, which detailed his own financial perilous financial state. =ost importantly, Gold could not produce any 
banking information to substant=ate the claim that he took the money that he received from Ensign, and gave=it to me 
to purchase these items. Therefore, Ensign was not able to sue me =r pursue the suit against us for books that I had fully 
paid for myself. Th=y then dropped the matter quickly. 
I have wanted to do an action against Ensign and Gold, but have lacked the =ecessary funds to do this, as well as remove 
that dreaded press release, as=the cost for this, had to go to pay off the various bills around here.
