HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
As of the date of this Memorandum, the Management Company categorizes its strategies 
into the following four groups in its reports to Limited Partners: (i) event-driven/merger arbitrage 
(which includes long/short equity); (ii) volatility trading; (iii) convertibles; and (iv) credit. 
Illustrative Trading Strategies and Techniques 
Certain of the specific trading strategies and techniques (including sub-strategies) that have 
historically been used for the Underlying Funds are outlined below for illustrative purposes. The 
following does not purport to be a complete list of all trading strategies employed, and certain of 
an Underlying Fund's trades may involve a combination of, or a departure from, these strategies. 
At different times, an Underlying Fund may employ certain, all or none of the following strategies 
and an Underlying Fund may also employ numerous other trading techniques, including strategies 
involving materially higher levels of risk than any of the following strategies. 
Event/Merger Arbitrage: Event/merger arbitrage involves the investing in Securities of an issuer 
which is involved in prospective mergers or corporate combinations, acquisitions, tender offers, 
exchange offers, corporate recapitalizations, litigation or spin-offs or other corporate action 
transactions with the expectation of profiting from the difference between the price of such 
Securities at the inception of the investment and the price of such Securities in expectation of or 
upon consummation of particular events. 
Derivative Arbitrage: Derivative arbitrage encompasses investment strategies that involve the 
purchase and sale of options, futures, warrants, swaps and other derivative Securities in 
anticipation of profiting from a relative mispricing between them. These transactions may be 
offset in the underlying principal markets. Examples of such strategies are commonly known as 
index arbitrage and volatility arbitrage. Underlying instruments can include equities, bonds, 
commodities or credit instruments. 
Options Arbitrage: Options arbitrage (also known as options-volatility trading) is a derivatives 
based strategy that seeks to profit from market turbulence or lack thereof, as reflected in 
movements in option prices that result from either market volatility or market fluctuations. The 
goal of this strategy is to buy inexpensively priced (Le, low implied volatility) options whose 
underlying instruments are historically more volatile, and sell expensively priced i.e. high 
implied volatility) options whose underlying instruments are historically less volatile. The strategy 
may be implemented through options on equities and equity indices. Such option combinations 
include spreads (buying an option to buy or sell an asset while simultaneously selling an option to 
buy or sell the same asset with a different expiration date or strike price) or straddles (option 
combinations that will profit from movement in the level of the value of an asset outside of certain 
bands, or the lack of such movement, without regard to whether the movement is upwards or 
downwards). Option volatility trading may also involve trades in which futures (or other 
derivatives) are used to create a position that synthetically resembles an option or option 
combination, or in which options are purchased or sold versus an offsetting position in the 
underlying market (such as a basket of stocks). The decision process is dependent on fundamental 
and technical analysis of the underlying instruments. Computer models may be used to enhance 
the execution of various hedges.
