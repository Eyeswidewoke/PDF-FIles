Steel Industry Outlook 
Sean-M Wondrack, ( 
Executive Summary 
2017 has been a far superior year for U.S. steel manufacturers than the past 
few years. A pickup in global demand trends, particularly around Europe and 
developing nations, coupled with underlying industrial strength in the U.S., has 
led to stronger U.S. steel prices YoY. We believe the vast majority of the U.S. 
market's relative stability in 2017 was attributable to robust domestic demand 
in China driven by strong investment in China's infrastructure and property 
markets. Currently Chinese domestic hot-rolled coil (HRC) is -20% higher YoY, 
a constructive sign for the global steel industry considering China represents 
50% of worldwide production despite its domestic market consuming only 
43% of the steel produced. Capacity utilization has also improved with the U.S. 
market registering above 70% since January 2017. With 2017 behind us, we 
see positive directional trends emerging as we enter calendar 2018. 
Investment Rationele 
We believe several U.S. steel companies have guided to a weaker Q4-2017 
YoY due to input costs that have risen faster than steel selling prices. Hence 
O4-2017 results are likely to be marred by input cost inflation and margin 
compression with the potential to recover in Q1-2018 if recently-announced 
selling price increases stick. Accordingly we believe the market is likely to be 
disappointed with Q4.2017 earnings yet bond prices are likely to recover given 
the more optimistic Q1-2018 outlooks from domestic steel companies. 
We believe the demand outlook for the U.S. moving forward is broadly positive 
and strengthening given positive steel indicators such as improving capacity 
utilization and higher U.S. domestic pricing amid a stable supply environment 
aided by China's pollution-driven supply curtailments during the winter months. 
Given our expectations for a stable organic demand environment in the U.S. in 
2018, we believe that performance in 2H-2018 is likely to be more dependent 
on China's steel demand maintaining equilibrium with supply, otherwise the 
risk exists that the U.S. market may once again become inundated with 
imports absent any serious legislation restricting imports. That said, should 
demand trends wane in China in 2H-2018, we believe the government is still 
more likely to implement additional stimulus measures to counteract a 
recession. Against this mixed backdrop, we recommend that investors are 
overweight the U.S. steel industry in 2018. While we concede that earnings in 
Q4-2017 are likely to be softer than expectations, we feel they are more likely 
to present a buying opportunity for investors who are willing to tolerate 
potential supply-driven risks associated with Chinese fiscal tightening. 
ArrielorriArttai's IMMAI USD-denominated bards with Bu•; ratings 
We initiate on all of MTNA's USD-denominated bonds with a Buy rating owing 
to our belief that the company will benefit from increased cash flow in 2018 on 
the back of stabilizing to growing global demand trends and apply that cash to 
further deleverage the organization. Management continues to make achieving 
IG credit ratings its highest priority. With a FCF yield greater than 20% amid 
minimal 1.5x net leverage and an almost entirely unsecured capital structure, 
we view MTNA as likely to achieve IG ratings at some point in the near-term. 
Therefore we believe the bonds will trade closer to IG indices than HY indices 
going forward and see MTNA as a "rising star."

Risks to the downside include 
growth-oriented M&A, slowing 
Chinese demand trends, input 
cost inflation, a reversal of 
MTNA's decision to achieve IG 
ratings, softer global economic 
trends, regulatory changes and 
lower steel prices.
