reorganization or liquidation situations, may not accurately value the assets of the subject 
company or the degree of legal and regulatory risk associated with investments in the securities 
of companies in such situations. 
Leverage. Use of leverage by the Partnership may be substantial. Leverage is the use of 
borrowed funds for trading and investment. Such borrowed funds would generally be obtained 
by using securities the Partnership owns as collateral. Leverage may be obtained through other 
means as well, including, without limitation, the use of derivative instruments. If the interest 
expense on borrowings were to exceed the net return on the positions acquired with borrowed 
funds, the Partnership's use of leverage would result in a lower rate of return than if the 
Partnership were not leveraged. If the amount of borrowings which the Partnership may have 
outstanding at any one time is large in relation to its capital, fluctuations in the market value of 
the Partnership's portfolio will have a disproportionately large effect in relation to its capital and 
the possibilities for profit and the risk of loss will therefore be increased. Any gains made with 
the additional monies borrowed will generally cause the value of the Partnership's assets to rise 
more rapidly than would otherwise be the case. Conversely, if the investment performance of 
the additional monies fails to cover their cost to the Partnership, the value of the Partnership's 
assets will generally decline faster than would otherwise be the case. The amount of any 
borrowing may also be limited by regulations imposed by the Federal Reserve Board or by the 
availability and cost of credit, as well as due to overall market conditions. If, due to market 
fluctuations or other reasons, the value of the Partnership's assets should fall below required 
regulatory levels, the Partnership will be required to reduce its debt by selling securities in its 
long portfolio. The Partnership may also be unable to carry-out its investment program if it is 
not able to obtain leverage on reasonable terms. 
Withdrawal of Capital. Limited Partners may withdraw capital only in accordance with 
the terms of this Memorandum and the Limited Partnership Agreement. (See "Outline of the 
Limited Partnership Agreement.") Substantial withdrawals by investors within a short period of 
time could require the Partnership to liquidate securities positions more rapidly than would 
otherwise be desirable, possibly reducing the value of the Partnership's assets and/or disrupting 
the Partnership's investment program. 
In-Kind Distributions. 
Although the General Partner intends to liquidate all of the 
Partnership's positions prior to the dissolution of the Partnership and distribute only cash to the 
Partners, there can be no assurance that the General Partner will meet this objective. In addition, 
if significant withdrawals are requested, the General Partner may be unable to liquidate the 
Partnership's positions at the time such withdrawals are requested or may be able to do so only at 
prices which the General Partner believes do not reflect the true value of such positions and 
which would adversely affect the Partners. Under the foregoing circumstances, the Limited 
Partners may receive in-kind distributions, if permitted by law or by contract, which in-kind 
distributions may include financial instruments, equity securities and other assets or instruments 
held by the Partnership as well as equity interests in subsidiaries of the Partnership or 
participating interests in assets owned by the Partnership. Such securities, instruments and other 
assets, which will be selected by the General Partner in its discretion will generally be distributed 
on a pro rata basis unless prevented by regulatory or legal circumstances. These assets may not 
be readily marketable or saleable and may have to be held by the Limited Partner, or by the
