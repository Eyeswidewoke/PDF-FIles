Table of Contents 
poultry by-product meals, artificial preservatives or corn and we deny that 
any of our grain-free products contain grains. We also assert that Nestle 
Purina's statements falsely imply that our products are not made in the 
United States and are subject to quality control issues. We allege that 
Nestle 
Purina's conduct as described in this lawsuit is aimed at destroying the 
reputation and goodwill of the BLUE brand and may induce consumers to 
make purchasing decisions based on Nestle Purina's false and misleading 
representations about the composition and sourcing of BLUE products. 
Our complaint in this lawsuit seeks, among other things, a preliminary and 
permanent injunction prohibiting Nestle Purina from disseminating such 
false information, as well as damages (including punitive damages), 
restitution and disgorgement of all profits attributable to their false and 
deceptive advertising. On June 4, 2014, this lawsuit was consolidated with 
the Nestle Purina lawsuit. We have since amended our pleading to name 
as additional defendants the two advertising and public relations agencies 
that assisted Nestle Purina with its advertising campaign. 
In the course of pretrial discovery in the consolidated Nestle Purina 
lawsuit, beginning in September 2014 documents and information 
were revealed that indicate that a facility owned by a major supplier of 
ingredients to the pet food industry, including Blue Buffalo, for a period of 
time, had mislabeled as "chicken meal" or "turkey meal" ingredients that 
contained other poultry-based ingredients that were inappropriate for 
inclusion in "chicken meal" or "turkey meal" under industry standards, and 
it appears that this mislabeling was deliberate. This conduct was 
undertaken by the supplier without our knowledge, and we have since ceased 
purchasing ingredients from this supplier. This supplier was one of 
our primary sources of chicken meal and turkey meal. As a result of the 
supplier's conduct, our advertising claims of "no chicken or poultry 
byproduct 
meals" were inaccurate as to products containing the mislabeled ingredients. 
Therefore, we may be exposed to false advertising liability to 
Nestle Purina and others to the extent a claimant can prove they were 
injured by our actions. Such liability may be material. We have brought 
thirdparty 
indemnity and damages claims, with respect to the Nestle Purina lawsuit, 
against the supplier that mislabeled the ingredients, as well as the 
broker for such mislabeled ingredients, and also have insurance coverage for 
some of the Nestle Purina lawsuit claims. However, we may not be 
able to fully recover from such supplier, broker or from our insurance the 
full amount of any damages we might incur in these matters. 
We are vigorously defending ourselves against the Nestle Purina and related 
class action lawsuits. However, Nestle Purina's allegations, 
whether made in their lawsuit or through press releases, social media or 
other public announcements, may result in a loss of consumer confidence 
in our brand and products and a reduction in our sales if consumers perceive 
us as being untruthful in our marketing and advertising and may 
materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, financial 
condition and results of operations, regardless of the outcome of the
