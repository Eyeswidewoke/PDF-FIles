(d) 
Borrower shall notify Lender in writing of the occurrence of an Event of Default 
pursuant to this Agreement promptly after such Event of Default has occurred, and in any event within ten 
(10) days thereafter. 
14. 
General Indemnification. Borrower shall pay, and shall indemnify and hold Lender, its 
directors, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns (each an "Indemnitee") harmless on an 
after-tax basis from and against, any and all liabilities, causes of action, claims, suits, penalties, damages, 
losses, costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), obligations, liabilities, demands and judgments, and 
Liens, of any nature whatsoever (collectively, a "Liability") arising out of or in any way related to: (a) the 
Loan Documents, (b) the manufacture, purchase, ownership, title, selection, acceptance, rejection, 
possession, lease, sublease, operation, use, maintenance, documenting, inspection, control, loss, 
damage, destruction, removal, storage, surrender, sale, use, condition, delivery, nondelivery, return or 
other disposition of or any other matter relating to any Item of Equipment or any part or portion thereof 
(including, in each case and without limitation, latent or other defects, whether or not discoverable, any 
claim for patent, trademark or copyright infringement) and any and all Liabilities in any way relating to or 
arising out of injury to persons, properties or the environment or any and all Liabilities based on strict 
liability in tort, negligence, breach of warranties or violations of any regulatory law or requirement, (c) a 
failure to comply fully with applicable law and (d) Borrower's failure to perform any covenant, or 
Borrower's breach of any representation or warranty, hereunder; provided, that the foregoing indemnity 
shall not extend to the Liabilities to the extent resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful 
misconduct of an Indemnitee. 
15. 
No Reduction. All payments due to the Lender under the Loan Documents, and all other 
terms, conditions, covenants and agreements to be observed and performed by Borrower thereunder, 
shall be made, observed or performed by Borrower without any reduction or deduction whatsoever, 
including any reduction or deduction for any set-off, recoupment, counterclaim (whether in tort, contract or 
otherwise) or for any tax, levy or impost. 
16 
Power of Attorney and Filing Authority. Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to file 
financing statements, either before or after an Advance and, if applicable, amendments and continuation 
statements, and execute in the name of Borrower any other documents, including applications for or 
transfers of title, that Lender may reasonably deem necessary to perfect and maintain Lender's interest in 
the Equipment, to exercise its rights and remedies hereunder and to fully consummate all transactions 
contemplated under this Agreement. Borrower hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints, with 
an interest, Lender as true and lawful attorney with power to sign the name of Borrower on any such 
documents. Borrower agrees promptly to execute and deliver to Lender such further documents or other 
assurances, and to take such further action, as Lender may from time to time reasonably request. Lender 
shall have the right to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver in the name of Borrower any and all checks, 
drafts and other instruments for the payment of money relating to the Collateral, and Borrower hereby 
waives notice of presentment, protest and non-payment of any instrument so endorsed. All acts of said 
attorney or designee are hereby ratified and approved, and said attorney or designee shall not be liable 
for any acts of omission or commission nor for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or of law, unless 
done with gross (not mere) negligence or willful misconduct; this power being coupled with an interest is 
irrevocable while any of the Obligations remain unpaid. 
17. 
Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Lender, its 
successors and assigns. 
Borrower shall not sublease or otherwise relinquish possession of any 
Equipment, or assign, transfer or encumber its rights, interest or obligation hereunder. Lender reserves 
the right to sell, assign, transfer, negotiate or grant any interest in all or any part of, or any interest in, 
Lender's rights and obligations in, under and to this Agreement, any Note, any one or more of the Loan 
Documents, in the Equipment and/or the Obligations, at any time and from time to time. Borrower will 
fully cooperate with Lender in connection with any such conveyance and will execute and deliver such 
consents and acceptances to any such conveyance, amendments to this Agreement in order to effect any 
such conveyance (including, without limitation, the appointment of Lender as agent for itself and all 
assignees) and new or replacement promissory notes for any Note (in an aggregate principal amount not 
to exceed the Lender's Commitment) in conjunction with any such conveyance.
