counsel to the Investment Manager and the General Partner. KKWC does not represent investors 
in the Partnership, and no independent counsel has been retained to represent investors in the 
Partnership. 
KKWC's representation of the Partnership, the General Partner, the Investment Manager 
and their respective affiliates is limited to specific matters as to which it has been consulted by 
the General Partner and/or the Investment Manager. There may exist other matters that could 
have a bearing on the Partnership as to which it has not been consulted. In addition, KKWC 
does not undertake (nor does it intend) to monitor the compliance of the General Partner, the 
Investment Manager and their respective affiliates with the investment program, valuation 
procedures and other guidelines set forth in this Memorandum, nor does it monitor compliance 
with applicable laws. In preparing this Memorandum, KKWC relied upon information furnished 
to it by the General Partner, the Investment Manager and/or their respective principals, and did 
not investigate or verify the accuracy and completeness of information set forth herein. 
OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE GENERAL PARTNER, INVESTMENT MANAGER; 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
Conflicts exist and may arise between the interests of the Investment Manager and the 
General Partner, and those of the Limited Partners. 
Other Business Relationships of the Investment Manager and the General Partner 
Each of the Investment Manager, the General Partner and their affiliates devotes as much 
of its time and resources to the activities of the Partnership as it deems necessary and 
appropriate. The Investment Manager, the General Partner and their affiliates are not restricted 
from entering into other investment advisory relationships or engaging in other business 
activities, even though such activities may be in competition with the Partnership and/or may 
involve substantial amounts of the Investment Manager's, the General Partner's or the affiliates' 
time and resources. The principal(s) of the Investment Manager may from time to time hold 
direct or indirect ownership interests in one or more other investment management companies, 
including those that share resources with the Investment Manager and/or co-invest with the 
Investment Manager. The Investment Manager and its affiliates provide investment advisory 
services to other private investment funds and/or managed accounts ("Other Accounts"), 
including the Hybrid Fund, which employ investment programs and strategies substantially 
similar to the Partnership, and which may compete with the Partnership for investments and 
Portfolio Managers. The Investment Manager and its affiliates may also establish additional 
Other Accounts, and engage in other business activities, in the future. These activities could be 
viewed as creating a conflict of interest in that neither the Investment Manager, the General 
Partner nor their respective affiliates is exclusively devoting its resources to the business of the 
Partnership but must allocate such resources between that business and other activities. Other 
Accounts could have compensation and profit sharing arrangements that differ from those 
provided in the Investment Management Agreement and the Limited Partnership Agreement 
which may create incentives that could affect the Investment Manager's and/or the General 
Partner's decisions as to how to allocate time, resources and investment opportunities.
