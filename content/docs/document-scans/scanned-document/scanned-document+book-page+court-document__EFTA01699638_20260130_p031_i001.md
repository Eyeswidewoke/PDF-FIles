unreasonable because it would force him to violate 
state law relating to grand jury secrecy. 
Second, 
he argues that the subpoena was served upon the 
wrong party. Third, the District Attorney contends 
that compliance would be unreasonable because it 
would violate policies of comity. Finally, he 
contends that the subpoenaed grand jury records are 
privileged. 
DISCUSSION 
[1][2][3] It is well-established that a federal grand 
jury is to be afforded wide latitude in conducting its 
investigation. 
See United States v. R. Enters., 
Inc., 498 U.S. 292, 297-98, 111 S.Q. 722, 726, 
112 L.Ed.2d 795 (1991); 
United Stares v. 
Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 
561 (1974). 
PA grand jury investigation 'is not 
fully carried out until every available clue has been 
run down and all witnesses examined in every 
proper way to find if a crime has been committed.' 
Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 701, 92 
S.Q. 2646, 2667, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972) (quoting 
United Sixes v. •Stone, 429 F.2d 138, 140 (24 
Cir.1970)); In re Grand Jury Subpoena for the 
Prod. of Certain New York State Saks Tax Records, 
382 F.Supp. 1205, 1206 (W.D.N.Y.1974) (quoting 
Stone. 429 F.2d at 140). 
In accordance with its 
broad mandate to investigate possible criminal 
activity, a federal grand jury has few limitations 
placed on its subpoena powers. R. Enters.. 498 
U.S. at 297-98, 111 S.Ct. at 726. "A grand jury 
'may compel the production of evidence or the 
testimony of witnesses as it considers appropriate, 
and its operation generally is unrestrained by the 
technical procedural and evidentiary rules governing 
the conduct of criminal trials.' " 
Id. (quoting 
Calandra, 414 U.S. at 343, 94 S.Ct. at 617). The 
only restrictions that have been placed upon the 
grand jury concern reasonableness and privileges. 
A grand jury subpoena may not be unreasonable or 
oppressive, and it may not violate a constitutional, 
common law or statutory privilege. Branzburg, 408 
U.S. at 68S, 92 S.Ct. at 2660; 
Fed.R.Crim.P. 
17(c). 
Grand jury subpoenas are presumed to be 
reasonable and the party seeking to quash the 
subpoena bears the burden of showing that 
compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive. 
R. Enters., 493 U.S. at 300-02, 111 S.Q. at 728. 
*333 In this case, the District Attorney contends 
that compliance with the subpoena would be 
unreasonable. 
In order to meet his heavy burden 
of showing that compliance with the subpoena 
Page 13 
would be unreasonable or oppressive, the District 
Attorney must prove that (1) "there is no reasonable 
possibility that the category of materials the 
Government seeks will produce information relevant 
to the general subject of the grand jury's 
investigation:" or (2) the subpoena is too indefinite; 
or (3) compliance would be overly burdensome. Id. 
After applying these tests to the instant case, the 
Court finds that the District Attorney is unable to 
rebut the presumption that the federal grand jury 
subpoena is reasonable. 
[4] Regarding the relevancy question, the United 
States has set forth in some detail, both in its motion 
papers and in its in camera submission, the reasons 
underlying the need for the state grand jury records. 
The United States has been unable to obtain the 
information contained in the grand jury records 
from other sources because the police officers have 
been unwilling to cooperate with the investigation. 
Accordingly, the Court funds that the statements of 
the police officers and other witnesses who testified 
before the state grand jury are relevant and 
necessary to the federal grand jury investigation. 
It does not appear that the District Attorney 
challenges the subpoena as being too indefinite or 
overly burdensome. 
The Court notes that the 
subpoena is discreet and calls for the production of 
specific material stemming from a particular state 
grand jury investigation. 
Thus, the subpoena is 
sufficiently definite. 
Further, the subpoena does 
not call for the production of an unreasonable 
amount of documents. 
Consequently, producing 
the requested material would require minimal effort 
on the part of the District Attorney's Office and 
therefore would not be overly burdensome. 
The District Attorney argues that compliance with 
the subpoena would be unreasonable because it 
would place him in a position where he would be 
violating state law provisions relating to grand jury 
secrecy. 
Specifically, the District Attorney argues 
that N.Y.Crim.Proc.Law § 190.25, subd. 4, 
requires that state grand jury materials be kept 
secret and therefore prohibits him from turning over 
the subpoenaed grand jury records to the United 
States. Be contends that the only way the United 
States can gai6 access to these materials is to file a 
motion 
in 
state 
court _p_iusuant 
to 
Y .0 
The 
Court finds this argument without merit.
