Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, 
market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The appropriateness or 
otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the 
investors' own circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory 
environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such 
investors should take expert legal and financial advice before 
entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this 
publication. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all 
investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the
