Re: Private and Confidential, in response to our meeting. 
heres =hat this says. i lawrence krauss will tell you how i thi=kyou should conduct your investigation , if at all. and = 
would like to participate in it. repsonse. go fuc= yourself. we will not share the file , all complaints a=e proteced from 
defamation and you must continue to cooperate.

=C2 I wanted to add to his letter, to reiterate our concern aq=ont>bout how your office was planning to follow up on 
the false and defamatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because this was initiated by an on=ine entertainment 
news outlet with a clear agenda and established record of propagating false allegations about me, rather than by any of 
the individuals they refer to as sources, this should not=be considered a credible allegation worthy of investigation. I 
beli=ve that our initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. Whether =r not you agree with this, there are two 
thi=gs I think are important to establish. 
F=rstly, that the University should not propagate what can be false allegations from such a source by presenting them 
directly to current and/or former employees or to others. To do so would be to further their libelous=20 agenda, as Mr 
Waldman has emphasized. In this regard,o cur=ent or former employees about this in the process of carrying out and 
concluding your investigation. 
your client,=Lawrence Krauss, copied me on his February 23rd email communication to the Office of Equity and 
Inclusion. I am writing to=20 convey the University's position on its responsibility to conduct=20 administrative 
investigations into allegations of conduct that would violate institutional policy, if true. Because Dr. Krauss has retained 
legal counsel, I am writing directly to you. You may forward m= communication on to your client. Without having first 
secured your permission, I did not think it was proper for me to copying him =n this reply. 
Our policy=on the Prohibition Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation (AC= 401

procedures (P20 — link to the procedures is=20 embedded in the policy document) directs the Office of Equity and 
Inclusion to conduct prompt and equitable investigations. Among the=20 points stated are that the Office accepts 
anonymous compla=nts as well as direct complaints. University employees are required to cooperate=20 with any 
investigation or allegations of violations of this policy. =20 Providing false or misleading information or failing to 
cooperate may result in disciplinary action. Individuals making a complaint or participating as a witness in an 
investigation cannot be retaliated against. Any employee who engages in retaliation will be disciplined.=C2 The Office 
of Equity and Inclusion does not make any findings until such time as it determines that it has completed its fact 
gathering. 
</=iv> 
Our courts recognize that <=ont size="6">participants in an administrative investigation have a priv=lege against a 
defamation charge. In Paros v. Hoemako Hospital= =A0140 Ariz. 335, 681 P.2d 918 (Ct. App. Div. 2 1984), the court 
recognized that the employer's response to a notice of charge of discriminatio= filed with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission was absolutely privileged. In Miller v. Servicemaster by Rees, 174 Ariz. at 520, 851 P.2d 240, 
243 (Ct. App. Div. 1 1993), the court recognized the existence of a conditional privilege for employees to report 
perceived acts of sexual harassment as public policy dictated that employees must be protected from workplace sexual
