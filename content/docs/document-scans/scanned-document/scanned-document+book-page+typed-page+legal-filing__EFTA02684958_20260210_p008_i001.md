from Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, 
Gabon, and Congo—people who 
rarely agree on anything. 
ey, let's go look at some blood," 
Wolfe called, summoning me 
to what has to be the coldest labora-
tory in West Africa. The institute—a 
series of fortified bungalows—sits in 
the middle of a secure camp on the 
grounds of the Cameroonian Mili-
tary Health Research Center, in central 
Yaounde. It doesn't feel particularly 
military, though—or, for that matter, 
secure. Just a few hundred yards away, 
scores of merchants—who seem to have 
cornered the global market on extension 
cords, plug adapters, and USB char-
gers—sell their wares along the wide 
avenues of the capital. 
The health-research complex has its 
own water supply, a liquid-nitrogen 
plant, and a series of freezers set at 
minus eighty degrees Celsius—an ideal 
temperature for preserving tissue speci-
mens. Wolfe stood in the middle of a 
row of cylinders, each filled with cryo-
genically preserved samples of blood 
and tissue, taken from hunters, bats, 
cane rats, gorillas, spot-nosed monkeys, 
chimpanzees, and scaly anteaters. 
Looking Californian in a maroon 
sport shirt and sneakers, he quickly un-
screwed one of the cylinders. A gust of 
nitrogen vapor swirled out. The speci-
mens in these containers make up per-
haps the most comprehensive library of 
human and animal blood work in Af-
rica. Hunters throughout the country 
now routinely carry filter paper, and 
when they kill a wild animal the hunt-
ers deposit a few drops of blood on the 
paper and seal it in a baggie (provided 
by G.V.F.). They can send the sample 
to the lab or wait until somebody comes 
to collect it. The idea arose from a 
method used by Matthew LeBreton to 
preserve dead snakes. "Everybody kills 
snakes. It is almost a reflex for humans," 
LeBreton told me. For years, he trav-
elled the length of the country, compil-
ing what would become the definitive 
book on the reptiles of Cameroon. "I 
would go to villages and ask people to 
just throw them in a pot of formalin, 
which preserved the snakes until I could 
collect and catalogue them." 
Neither LeBreton nor Wolfe be-
lieves that it pays to be too picky about 
the specimens they obtain. "You do not 
wait for perfection," LcBreton told me. 
"When ... we work with bats, we can 
get specimens into liquid nitrogen in 
the field. You can't get better speci-
mens. They are frozen instantly. But it 
is critical for our work that we not wait 
for something to be perfect. Because it's 
never perfect." 
The blood samples have already pro-
vided enough data for scores of scientific 
publications. Last year, scientists relied 
on the G.V.F. registry to identify the 
source of Plasmodium falciparum, the 
form of malaria that has probably killed 
more people than any other living or-
ganism. The origins and the evolution-
ary history of the parasite have always 
been murky. Because malaria is so wide-
spread among humans, and so deadly, 
for years the most common scientific 
theory held that humans passed the dis-
ease to other primates. To test the hy-
pothesis, Wolfe, Stephen Rich, of the 
University of Massachusetts, and others 
examined the genetic structure of a hun-
dred samples of the chimpanzee version 
of the malaria parasite—P. reithenowi. 
They identified eight strains that collec-
tively were far more genetically diverse 
than the human form. In fact, P. faki-
parum could, in most cases, be con-
structed from the genes of the chimp 
virus. That could only mean that the 
human form came from chimps, not the 
other way around. 
Wolfe's team has also used its blood 
samples to search for variants of a virus 
called H.T.L.V.—human T-lympho-
tropic virus—which infects millions of 
people and causes leukemia and neuro-
logical illnesses. There had been two 
known strains—H.T.L.V.-1 and 
H.T.L.V.-2—and researchers found 
evidence of both viruses in the primate 
blood samples; they also discovered 
two new viruses, which they named 
H.T.L.V.-3 and H.T.L.V.-4. `This is 
an astonishing array of viruses," Don-
ald Burke told me. "We have no idea 
how easily those viruses adapt to hu-
mans. Or how easily they can be trans-
mitted between humans. But we better 
get prepared. Because, frankly, what we 
already know should be enough to 
frighten us all." 
year, Wolfe joined with a team 
of African, French, and American re-
searchers to report a twentyfold increase 
in the incidence of monkeypox in 
Congo since the early nineteen-eighties. 
At first glance, the results were inexpli-
cable. Then a pattern emerged: Vac-
cinia, the vaccine used so successfully 
to eradicate smallpox, also protects 
against monkeypox. After the last 
known case ofsmallpox occurred, in So-
malia, in 1977, however, the virus was 
considered officially eradicated. In most 
countries, the vaccinations soon 
stopped, and when they did, a critical 
line of defense against monkeypox was 
lost. 'The eradication ofsmallpox is one 
of the triumphs of medical history," 
Wolfe said. "But nothing in biology is 
simple." 
Wolfe sat atop a freezer and dangled 
his legs like a schoolboy. The monkey-
pox finding was particularly gratifying 
to him because it demonstrated the un-
foreseen complexities of biological sys-
tems. 'There is a thought experiment 
that I like: Wolfe said. ('Thought ex-
periment' is a phrase he uses often.) 
"Let's just say you had a light switch on 
the wall and you could flip that switch 
and destroy every virus on the planet. 
Would you flip that switch? Almost ev-
eryone would say yes. But the effect on 
the planet would be so profound that 
life as we know it would cease to exist." 
Wolfe may be the viral world's most 
vigorous apologist, but he isn't wrong. 
Viruses can kill, yet they are also essen-
tial. In fact, vaccinia, which defeated 
smallpox, is itself a virus closely related 
to cowpox. In some parts ofJapan, there 
have long been high rates of infection 
with H.T.L.V.-1, which can cause leu-
kemia. People who are infected with 
that virus, however, are far less likely to 
develop stomach cancer than those who 
are not. In a study that followed a thou-
sand people, participants were two and 
a half times as likely to develop stomach 
cancer if they were free of H.T.L.V.-1 
than if they were infected. 
Bacteria, the dominant life form on 
earth, are often controlled by viruses. 
They help regulate marine photosyn-
thesis, and without them there would 
likely be no algae and no fish in the sea. 
In fact, earlier this year a team of re-
searchers from M.I.T. managed to pro-
gram viruses to mimic the process by 
which plants use sunlight to manufac-
ture the chemicals they need to live. 
The reason we think of viruses as ncg-
