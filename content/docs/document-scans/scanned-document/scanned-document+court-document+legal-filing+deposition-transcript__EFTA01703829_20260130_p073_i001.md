payment does not conform to these requirements, crediting may be delayed and additional Charges may be imposed. If we 
accept payment made in a foreign currency, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us to convert your 
payment into US dollars, unless a particular rate is required by law Please do not send post-dated checks. They will be 
deposited upon receipt bur acceptance of any payment marked with a restncvve legend will not operate as an accord and 
satisfaction without our express prior written aPdroval. Authorization for Electronic Debit: We will process checks 
electronically, at first presentment and any re-presentments, by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number, 
account number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the check is not processable electronically or a 
less costly process is available. By submitting a check for payment, you authorize us to initiate an electronic debt from your

account as soon as the same day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your bank a 
asset account statement If we cannot collect the funds electronically we may issue a draft against your bank a asset

or any other electronic payment service of ours, you will be authonzing us to initiate an eledronic debt to the financial

day. Allocation of Payments and Credits: Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits 
among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our solediscretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature (including current transactions) Different daily 
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous billing periods) (2) add any new transactions, debts, or fees (3) 
subtract any payments or cr 
and (4) make any appropriate adjustments For each day after the first day of the billing 
period, we also add an amount
edts  of interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero Then, we add pp all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the ADB for the Feature. If you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance If you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in the tilling period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the (eta will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total FC for the 
billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account This method of calculating the .408 
and FC results in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made In Foreign Currencies: If yai incur a Charge in a 
foreign currency, it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that is ain,uutable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by us from Customary banking sources, on the 
conversion date or the poor business day, In each Instance increased by 2%. This conversion rate may differ from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such 
establishments use. Billing Rig is Summary:  In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill: If you think your bill is 
incorrect, or if you need more information about atransaction on your al, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the 
Customer Service address noted to the right. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on
