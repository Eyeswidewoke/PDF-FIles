I htought it might be helpful if you had real facts =efore we speak. could you please ask yourself , do you =hink you 
have been fair. - truly . I know i dont think s=. I m certain karp doesnt think so but you can check with him =ourself. 
and i was told repeatedly by wechsler that you "=just dont like paying money" though he called to say how much 
&=uot; value you and he thought i had contributed :IT appears that th= only person that knows the facts that thinks 
you have been fair is you.=C2 ask yourself how is it possible that you havent even offered =o reimburse me for money 
paid out on your behalf . 
mone=s for your tax returns in april. october , the gift tax. , and the =ift tax audit and its 
results all took my time and expertise ( me , the on=y professional that you choose not to pay , as you continue to 
suggest tha= you" expect" things from me. ) I would ask yo= why you would ask me to detail the largest transaction in 
your personal l=fe and then not pay me for that work. I believe in you I cant figure=it out You have in the past 
suggested that our negotiated for=ula was never in play though each time the subject of money came =AO up you have 
historically said i need to see " value " =C2 , but then , even when shown you have to admit to =ourself that you 
created a different reason not to pay. . ..AO ask yourself if the original giacometti , schiele plu= transaction had a 
balanced component. that allowed bot= you and I to benefit . but the fee component was =gnored . and you said , 
if I can take you at your word, =. the work you dismiss on the 8865 as only a few changes. =AO after hours and hours of 
work, leads me to the conclusion that =AO focusing my time on your risks is not really worth it to either you or = . With 
your new self reflection, there is no rush to any of t=ese answers , take the time to really think about what ive said. 
=AO I have little enthusiasm for further interaction with your office. =AO Barry callled this morning, and I gave him a 
broad stroke visio= to the TRA . however as you know, still nothing done on the f=ll fire drill or further estate plan. 
There is no hurt involve=. I know that you would never intentionally do anything that would c=use me hurt. It is 
frustration that your behavior is so high risk an= self destructive and my inability to guide you to a place of safety with 
=he recognition and compensation that it deserves. Saving you f=om yourself and then being told you cant see the 
value is hearbreaking =AO not hurtful.
