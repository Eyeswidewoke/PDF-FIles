(c) 
The Mortgagee, to the extent permitted by law, may from time to time adjourn 
any sale under paragraph (aXi) above by announcement at the time and place appointed for such 
sale or for any adjournment thereof; and without further notice or publication, such sale be made 
at the time and place to which the same shall have been so adjourned. 
(d) 
Upon the completion of any sale under paragraph (aXi) above, full title and right 
of possession to the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft so sold shall (subject to any 
retention of title by the Mortgagee as part of the terms of such sale) pass to the accepted 
purchaser forthwith upon the completion of such sale, and the Grantor shall deliver, in 
accordance with the instructions of the Mortgagee (including flying any Aircraft or causing the 
same to be flown to such airports in the continental United States as the Mortgagee may specify), 
such Mortgage Collateral so sold. If the Grantor shall for any reason fail to deliver such 
Mortgage Collateral, the Mortgagee shall have all of the rights granted by subsection 6.2 hereof. 
The Mortgagee is hereby irrevocably appointed the true and lawful attorney of the Grantor, in its 
name and stead, to make all necessary conveyances of any Mortgage Collateral so sold. 
Nevertheless, if so requested by the Mortgagee or by any purchaser, the Grantor shall confine 
any such sale or conveyance by executing and delivering all proper instruments of conveyance or 
releases as may be designated in any such request. 
6.4 
Waiver of Appraisement. etc. The Grantor agrees, to the fullest extent that it 
lawfully may, that it will not (and hereby irrevocably waives its right to) at any time plead, or 
claim the benefit or advantage of, any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, moratorium or 
redemption law now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement of this 
Mortgage or the absolute sale of the Mortgage Collateral. 
6.5 
Remedies Cumulative. No remedy herein conferred upon the Mortgagee is 
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but every such remedy shall be cumulative and 
shall be in addition to every other remedy herein conferred or now or hereafter existing in law. 
6.6 
Application of Proceeds. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing, the proceeds of any sale, lease or other disposition of all or any part of the Mortgage 
Collateral pursuant to this Mortgage and all other sums realized or held by the Mortgagee under 
this Mortgage or any proceedings hereunder shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the 
Credit and Security Agreement. 
6.7 
Delay or Omission: Possession of Loan Certificates. 
(a) 
No delay or omission of the Mortgagee to exercise any right or remedy arising 
upon the happening of any Default or Event of Default shall impair any right or remedy or shall 
be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; 
and every right and remedy given to the Mortgagee by this Section 6, the Loan Documents or by 
applicable law may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by 
the Mortgagee. 
(b) 
All rights of action under this Mortgage may be enforced by the Mortgagee 
without the possession of the Notes or any other instrument or document evidencing any 
obligation or the production thereof in any proceeding.
