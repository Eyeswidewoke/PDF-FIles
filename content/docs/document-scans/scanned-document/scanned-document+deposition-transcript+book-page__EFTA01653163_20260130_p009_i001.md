Politico, Trump's advisers want the president to hammer 
Democrats for trying to subvert the will of the voters in 2016, 
depriving the country of Trump's strong economy and 
America First foreign policy.' A 'former Trump adviser who 
remains close to the White House" is quoted as saying, "What 
it does is go to the broader argument: Partisan Democrats 
are trying to undo an American election. ... It's 'us against 
them' instead of 'him against the world.'" The CBS Evening 
News (11/13, story 3, 2:10, O'Donnell, 4.47M) reported 'two 
spokespeople...are slated to join the White House staff, 
including the former Attorney General of Florida, Pam Bondi, 
don't have start dates." CBS News "has learned they're in the 
process of completing paperwork, which takes time. And a 
senior White House official told us it won't make much 
difference because they say the current messaging plan is 
working." 
Also on the CBS Evening News (11/13, story 4, 0:40, 
O'Donnell, 4.47M), Major Garrett said "the President knows 
and his staff knows for this week and next week, this will be 
Washington's biggest story. What does that mean 
for...Trump? Awkwardly, he'll be the sub-headline in 
Washington's biggest headline story. Not accustomed to 
being there." The White House also "knows this complicates 
his entire domestic agenda, and talks to advert a government 
shutdown possibly next week. And, all these other things 
bleed away at the margins what political clout he has on 
Capitol Hill."

he 
was 
"with...Zelensky the very next day" after the call, Taylor said 
he was. Pressed on whether "Zelensky raise any concerns 
about his views of the call," Taylor replied, "He said — so, 
right, so — so I, Ambassador [Kurt] Volker, Ambassador 
[Gordon] Sondland, were in his office, and we asked him, I 
think, how the call [went]. He said, 'The call was fine. I was 
happy with the call." 
Eric Trump: No One Outside Beltway "Gives A 
Damn" About Hearings. Eric Trump said on Fox News' The 
Story (11/13), 'There is not a single person outside the 
Washington Beltway that gives a damn about what happened 
today. It's boring. ... No one was watching it. No one cares. 
This is going to change one person's mind. They flopped 
horribly.'

Lawmakers Question OMB's Sandy, Release 
Transcripts From Another Two Closed-Door 
Impeachment Hearings. On the NBC Nightly News 
(11/16, story 2, 2:28, Diaz-Balart, 5.31M), which was the sole 
network newscast to broadcast last night, Jose Diaz-Balart 
said Congress Vrapp[ed] up an historic week in the 
impeachment inquiry into President Trump with a rare 
Saturday session" that featured the 'career budget official" 
Mark Sandy, the deputy associate director for national 
security programs at the White House Office of Management 
and Budget, who "broke ranks with the President to tell his 
side of the story: Garrett Hake added that in "another crack 
in the White House impeachment fire wall." 
The Washington Post (11/15, Demirjian, Bade, Itkowit, 
Werner, 14.2M) reports Sandy lestified...that the White 
House decision to freeze military aid to Ukraine in mid-July 
was highly irregular and that senior political appointees in the 
Office of Management and Budget were unable to provide an 
explanation for the delay.' The Post adds that his testimony 
"appeared to confirm Democrats' assertion that the decision 
to withhold nearly $400 million in congressionally approved 
kinds for Ukraine, including millions in lethal aid, was a 
political one: 
In a front-page article, the New York Times (11/16, Al, 
Fandos, 18.61M) reports that Sandy "testified that he was 
instructed to sign the first of several apportionment letters in 
which budget officials formally instituted the freeze on funds, 
according to two people familiar with his testimony who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. He was never 
given a specific reason as to why the letter was being sent 
out, the people added." The Times says that after their 
interview with Sandy 'concluded, Democrats released 
transcripts of two more witness interviews that took place in 
recent weeks. They included Timothy Morrison, the senior 
director for Europe and Russia for the National Security 
Council, and Jennifer Williams, a longtime State Department 
employee with expertise in Europe and Russia who is 
detailed to Vice President Mike Pence's national security 
staff." 
Bloomberg (11/16, House, 4.73M) reports Morrison 
"told House impeachment investigators Ukrainians were 
advised Sept. 1 that U.S. military aid was being withheld until 
their president announced an investigation of a company that 
had hired former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter." 
Bloomberg adds Morrison "said Gordon Sondland, the 
ambassador to the European Union, told him how he had 
informed a high-ranking Ukrainian official that release of $400 
million in aid was being linked to the investigations, according 
to a transcript of his closed-door testimony released
