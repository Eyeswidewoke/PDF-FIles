default shall have expired, under the Investment and Restructuring Agreement, dated June __, 
2003, by and among Borrower, Raytheon Travel Air Company, Raytheon Aircraft Holdings, 
Inc., and others (the "IRA") or under any of the Transaction Agreements (as defined in the IRA) 
other than this Agreement, and such default is a material default under the IRA or any of the 
Transaction Agreements (except those issues relating to governance in the ordinary course under 
the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Flight Options, 
LLC, dated of even date herewith), or (ii) Borrower defaults under any note (other than the Notes 
(as defined herein)) made payable to the order of Lender or to any parent, subsidiary, or Affiliate 
of Lender (excluding Borrower). In the event Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation (the original 
Lender in this Agreement) assigns this Agreement in whole or in part to a third party assignee 
(other than to a parent, subsidiary, or Affiliate of Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation, in which

set forth in Section 11(0(i) hereof is a default of Borrower's non-monetary obligations under the

provides written notice to Borrower of such default, and (ii) the expiration of a period of fifteen 
(15) business days (the "15-Day Cure Period"), to allow Borrower to cure such default; 
provided that during such 15-Day Cure Period, for so long as the default continues, Lender shall
