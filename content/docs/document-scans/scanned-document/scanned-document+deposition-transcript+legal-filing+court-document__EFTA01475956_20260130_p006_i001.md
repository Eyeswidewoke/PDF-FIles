World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Introduction and Summary 
Barring a significant negative economic or financial shock in the week ahead, 
the long-awaited turn toward the normalization of US monetary policy should 
finally get under way before the end of this year. The 25-basis-point fed 
funds 
rate hike now widely anticipated at the Fed's December meeting would be the 
first such move since June 2006. In the year ahead, we could also see signals 
that the monetary spigots in Europe will begin to close as well. While such 
signals are probably more than a year away in Japan, we don't expect the BoJ 
to add to its asset purchases, implying a gradual easing of stimulus there. 
In a 
world that has been awash with central bank liquidity for most of the past 
decade, there is both great curiosity and great concern about how the global 
economy and financial markets will react as the tap is finally shut on that 
liquidity. This question is a central focus of our World Outlook for 2016. 
The pivot away from this great monetary experiment is unprecedented and will 
not be without risks. However, we expect both the world economy and global 
financial markets to weather this turn in policy reasonably well, partly 
because 
major central banks -- and the Fed in particular -- have made it abundantly 
clear that they will be moving far more cautiously than they have in the 
past as 
they withdraw accommodation. Markets appear so far to have settled 
comfortably into the expectation that the Fed will be moving very slowly, 
expecting only about half the pace of hikes as the median Fed expectation, 
which is, in turn, about half the pace of historical Fed hiking cycles. 
The economic backdrop should allow for this gradual pace of policy 
normalization, at least initially. Global growth has been slowed by 
significant 
headwinds on both the demand side and the supply side of major economies. 
While moderate consumer spending growth has increasingly been the 
principal driver of a sluggish recovery, capital spending has been very slow 
to 
advance. A result of weak business investment has been that labor 
productivity growth has slowed to historically low rates in advanced 
economies. The inevitable slowing of China's economy to a more sustainable 
pace has also been a significant headwind to growth with dramatic 
implications for the world economy. China's slowdown has been a major 
factor underlying the weakening of commodity markets, trade flows, business 
investment, and manufacturing activity globally. 
But the slow growth of supply—or decline in potential growth—has also meant 
that sluggish recoveries in demand have been able to achieve considerable 
progress in removing economic slack. The US and Japanese economies are 
already nearing full employment, and even Europe's labor market has shown 
gains. The progress to date in reducing unemployment will help, along with 
the stabilization of energy and other commodity prices, to push inflation 
higher 
in the year ahead from recent extreme lows. The prospective pickup in wage 
and price inflation, as well as the continuing improvement in the labor
