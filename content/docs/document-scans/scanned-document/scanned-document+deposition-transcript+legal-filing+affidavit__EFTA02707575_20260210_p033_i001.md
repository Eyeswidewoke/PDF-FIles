19. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
ASC 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation, requires that compensation costs relating to share-
based payment transactions be recognized in the consolidated financial statements, with the cast 
measured based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Costs 
attributable to stock appreciation rights and unit appreciation rights granted subsequent to the adoption 
of ASC 718 are recognized in accordance with the graded vesting attribution method. 
KUE L.P. Unit Appreciation Rights — KUE L.P. has a Unit Appreciation Rights Plan. KUE L.P.'s 
Unit Appreciation Rights Plan has been approved by the Board of Directors of KUE Management Inc., 
the Company's general partner, and provides the Company with the authority to grant unit appreciation 
rights to directors, officers, and key employees of the Company. The unit appreciation rights vest 
annually over a period of up to five years from the grant date, have an expiration date of 10 years from 
the grant date, and are redeemable in cash at the holder's discretion. Fifty percent of the unit 
appreciation rights that vest during a year are exercisable upon vesting, and the remaining balance is 
exercisable upon occurrence of certain conditions, such as termination of employment. 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, ICUE L.P. had 3,829 and 9,976 unit appreciation rights outstanding, 
respectively, of which 2,026 and 8,872 unit appreciation rights, respectively, were fully vested. During 
2011, the Company canceled 8,527 unit appreciation rights. No compensation expense has been 
recorded for 2011 and 2010, as the exercise price of the unit appreciation rights was higher than the 
approximate fair values at December 31, 2011 and 2010. 
KS Stock Appreciation Rights — KUEH's subsidiary, KS, adopted a stock appreciation rights (SARs) 
plan in April 2004. The SARs plan has been approved by KS' Board of Directors and provides KS with 
the authority to grant SARs to certain employees of KS and its subsidiaties. SARS have been granted to 
certain directors and key employees of KUEH. The SARs vest annually over a period of up to five years 
from the grant date, have an expiration date of 10 years from the grant date, and are redeemable in cash 
at the holder's discretion. KS recognizes a liability for the vested portion and compensation expense is 
charged for the change in the intrinsic value of the vested awards during the year. The intrinsic value is 
the estimated fair value at the end of the reporting period. KUEH recognizes compensation expense for 
the change in the intrinsic value of the SARs granted to KUEH employees. 
As of December 31, 2011, KS had 3,629 SARs outstanding, related to certain directors and key 
employees of KUEH and its subsidiaries, of which all were fully vested. As of December 31, 2010, KS 
had 3,733 shares of SARs outstanding related to certain directors and key employees of KUEH and its 
subsidiaries, of which 3,661 were fully vested. No SARs were issued or exercised during either of the 
fiscal years 2011 or 2010. During the fiscal year 2011, KUEH recognized a $3.3 million reduction in 
compensation expense related to SARs. Compensation expense related to SARs was $0.2 million during 
fiscal year 2010. The intrinsic values of the SARS outstanding and exercisable were $2.3 million and 
$5.6 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
KS awards stock option grants to certain directors and key employees of KUEH and its subsidiaries. As 
of December 31, 2011 and 2010, KS had no stock options outstanding. As the stock options are 
redeemable at the holder's discretion, upon vesting, KUEH recognizes a liability for the vested portion 
and compensation expense is charged or credited for the change in the intrinsic value of the vested 
awards during the year. During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, no compensation expense was recognized in 
connection with vested options. There were no intrinsic values of stock options outstanding and 
exercisable as of December 31, 2011 or 2010.
