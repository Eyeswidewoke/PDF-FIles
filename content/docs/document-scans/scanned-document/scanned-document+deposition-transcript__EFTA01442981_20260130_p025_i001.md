GLDUS144 Glenn Warren 
The Access Fund will make its investment in the Underlying Fund at 
closings of the Underlying Fund on or after the Initial Closing, and if 
any Limited Partner increases its Subscription or any additional Limited 
Partners are admitted to the Access Fund at a Subsequent Closing, the 
Access Fund may make additional investments in the Underlying Fund, 
upon subsequent closings of the Underlying Fund, at the discretion of 
the Investment Manager, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the 
date of any increase in Subscriptions or admission of additional Limited 
Partners. In the event that a Subsequent Closing occurs after the Access 
Fund's initial investment in the Underlying Fund, existing Investors' 
interests in the Underlying Fund may be diluted to the extent that the 
Access Fund does not subsequently make a corresponding additional 
investment in the Underlying Fund. The General Partner is under no 
obligation to make a corresponding additional investment in the 
Underlying Fund in connection with any Subsequent Closing. 
Investors admitted at Subsequent Closings will participate in the Access 
Fund's existing investments in the Underlying Fund, which may dilute 
the Interests of existing Limited Partners and may indirectly participate 
in the existing investments of the Underlying Fund, to the extent the 
Access Fund is permitted by the general partner of the Underlying Fund 
(the "Glendower GP") to participate in such existing investments, 
which may dilute the Interests of existing Limited Partners and partners 
of the Underlying Fund, including the Access Fund. For the avoidance 
of doubt, investments made and disposed of prior to a particular 
Subsequent Closing will not be allocated to any Investors admitted at 
such Subsequent Closing. Although Investors admitted at Subsequent 
Closings will make capital contributions such that all Investors will have 
made proportional capital contributions (based on their Subscriptions) to 
the Access Fund, there can be no assurances that the amount paid by 
such Investors will reflect the fair value of their pro rata share of the 
Underlying Fund at the time of the Subsequent Closings. 
Term 
The term of the Access Fund is currently expected to end within one year 
following the dissolution of the Underlying Fund, but may be extended 
for two additional one-year periods beyond the one-year anniversary of 
the dissolution of the Underlying Fund at the discretion of the General 
Partner or may be terminated, liquidated and dissolved earlier in certain 
limited situations outlined in the Partnership Agreement. 
Parallel Access Funds and 
Feeder Funds 
The General Partner may form one or more limited partnerships or other 
investment vehicles to invest in parallel with the Access Fund (each, a 
"Parallel Access Fund") and/or feeder funds, including the Offshore 
Access Fund (as defined below) (collectively, "Feeder Funds") in order 
to comply with securities laws or to address tax, legal, regulatory or other 
issues of investors in such entity or program. The Access Fund, any 
Parallel Access Fund and any Feeder Fund (including the Offshore 
Access Fund) shall share common fees and expenses related to their 
operation and investments in proportion to the capital invested by each 
Proprietary and Confidential
