our food safety and quality program includes strict guidelines for incoming 
ingredients, batching, processing, packaging and finished goods. As 
part of our focus on safety and quality, we have implemented FDA-approved 
batch and lot traceability controls across our manufacturing network, 
including at our Heartland facility, where such controls have been 
implemented into our SAP ERP system. These controls allow us to track and tie 
discreet, inbound raw material components through the manufacturing process 
to the ultimate finished product, allowing us to maintain and control 
all finished product lot details and quickly access process manufacturing 
details. However, despite our strict quality controls, it is possible that 
there 
may be from time to time, as there has been in the past, issues or concerns 
with respect to our products. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our 
Business and Industry—We may face issues with respect to raw materials and 
other supplies, including increased costs, disruptions of supply, 
shortages, contaminations, adulterations or mislabeling" and "Risk Factors--
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—If our products are 
alleged to cause injury or illness or fail to comply with governmental 
regulations, we may need to recall our products and may experience product 
liability claims." We do not produce any of our products in Asia, where the 
oversight of the ingredient sourcing/purchasing and manufacturing can 
be difficult to manage. Many of our competitors' products, including some 
Wholesome Natural products, are produced in Asia. 
Our food safety and quality program also requires that finished goods are 
tested to ensure proper nutrition and the absence of microbial 
contaminants such as salmonella. These tests are performed at independent 
third-party and our internal laboratories. We do not release our products 
to customers without first receiving test results from these independent 
third-party or internal laboratories. 
Strong Position at Our Retailers and Distribution Partners 
As a leader in advertising and brand-building in the pet food category, we 
continue to drive traffic to brick-and-mortar stores and 
eCommerce retailers where BLUE is sold. In addition to the regular traffic 
we help generate, we believe our products are attractive to retailers 
given the strong gross margins they deliver to retailers. We work with our 
retail partners to customize product assortment, starting with the highest 
sales velocity items that fit their customer base in order to optimize our 
retail partners' economics. With our broad product portfolio, we see an 
opportunity to continue to increase our shelf space, especially outside of 
national pet superstores. These dynamics have made us a strong partner to 
our retailers, as we continue to increase the breadth and depth of our 
distribution. 
Sales through the eCommerce channel represented approximately 4% of our U.S. 
retail sales in 2014 compared to approximately 2% of 
U.S. pet food sales overall. We intend to strengthen our partnerships with 
our brick-and-mortar retail partners on their eCommerce and internet 
marketing programs, as well as with online-only eCommerce retailers to 
continue to grow in this rapidly developing channel. As of mid-2014, we 
switched larger eCommerce accounts from distributors to direct Blue Buffalo
