Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Fogo de Chao, Inc. 
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
(in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. 
The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after 
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. 
The Company will be required to adopt this new standard in the first 
quarter of Fiscal 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The ASU permits the 
use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. 
The Company has not yet selected a transition method or determined the 
effect, if any, that this ASU will have on its consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures. 
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial 
Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure 
of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." 
ASU 2014-15 will require management to evaluate whether there are 
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability 
to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial 
statements are issued. The new standard is effective for the annual period 
ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim 
periods thereafter. The Company will be required to adopt this new standard 
Fiscal 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU 
to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-2, "Consolidation (Topic 
820): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis." ASU 2015-2 
provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in 
evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal 
entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation 
model. The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies 
the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities 
are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a 
general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies 
the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with 
VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-2 is 
effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal 
years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company will be required to 
adopt this new standard Fiscal 2016. The Company is currently in the 
process of evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this ASU will 
have on its consolidated financial statements. 
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of 
Debt Issuance Costs," which changes the presentation of debt 
issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to 
present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the 
related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs 
will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for fiscal 
years, 
and interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after 
December 15, 2015. The Company will be required to adopt this new 
standard in the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. The new guidance will be
