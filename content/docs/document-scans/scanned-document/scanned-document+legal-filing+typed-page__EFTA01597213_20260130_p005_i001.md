UBS Client Relationship Agreement 
Introduction 
At UBS, we understand that we succeed only when our clients succeed. With that in mind, 
we provide a customized approach to wealth management, built on your personal 
relationship with your Financial Advisor and shaped by an understanding of your needs 
and aspirations. 
Known as the Client Relationship Agreement, this document outlines the terms and 
conditions of your relationship with us. By maintaining your Accounts at UBS, you agree to 
these terns and conditions and the other agreements and disclosures we refer to here. If 
signatures are required, please return the signed signature page in the enclosed envelope. 
To confirm that our records are complete, we will send you a record of the information you 
give us after you open a new Account. Please review the Client Information and Account 
Information pages of the Completing Your Account Opening Process package and notify 
us promptly if there are any updates or corrections. 
Please note: this Client Relationship Agreement applies to all of your Accounts at UBS, 
including any Accounts you may already have with us and Accounts you may open in the 
future. You will not receive another copy of the Client Relationship Agreement or the 
Agreements and Disclosures unless there are updates and amendments, or if we require 
your signature on this Agreement when you open Accounts in another capacity. Some of 
the information in this document and the other agreements and disclosures we send you 
may not apply to you now. Please retain these documents for future reference because 
they contain important information if you decide to add services or open new Accounts. 
The terms and conditions in this Client Relationship Agreement apply to all Accounts you 
open with UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico 
or any other introducing broker-dealer that has a clearing agreement with UBS Financial 
Services Inc. In addition, we will send you other agreements and disclosures for the services 
you choose when you open your account, as well as features you may add in the future. 
We refer to all these documents, including any amendments, as the Agreements and 
Disclosures booklet. 
Your acceptance of your initial Client Relationship Agreement will serve as your agreement 
to the terms and conditions governing any new Accounts, features or services. Deposits of 
cash or securities and your continued use of your UBS Accounts constitute your agreement 
to all of the terms and conditions applicable to your Accounts. If you do not agree to the 
terms and conditions, you may cancel a feature or service or close your account. 
As a UBS client, you may decide to open additional Accounts or take advantage of services 
and account features in the future. With some exceptions, you will be able to do so 
without signing additional documents or agreements. Upon approval of your accounts and 
services, we will confirm your requests in writing and provide any relevant agreements and 
disclosures you have not already received. Any authorization of features and services you 
give us will remain in effect until a reasonable time after you notify us to terminate the 
feature or service. 
It is important to note that when we act as your broker-dealer, we do not enter into a 
fiduciary relationship with you, regardless of the fee structure you select. Except in special 
circumstances, we are not held to the same legal standards that apply when we have a 
fiduciary relationship with you, as we do when providing investment advisory services. We 
will effect transactions for your brokerage Accounts only as instructed by you, and neither 
UBS Financial Services Inc. nor your Financial Advisor will have any discretion over your 
Accounts.
