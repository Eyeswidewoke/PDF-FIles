Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and 
operating results. 
Our growth plan includes opening a number of new restaurants. Our existing 
restaurant management systems, administrative staff, financial 
and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support 
our planned expansion. Those demands on our infrastructure and 
resources may also adversely affect our ability to manage our existing 
restaurants. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to 
enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain 
managers, gaucho chefs and other team members. We may not respond 
quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our 
management, restaurant teams and existing infrastructure which 
could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We believe our gaucho culture is an important contributor to our success. As 
we grow, however, we may have difficulty maintaining our 
culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations. Our 
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially 
adversely affected if we do not maintain our infrastructure and culture as 
we grow. 
We have a history of net losses and may incur losses in the future. 
We incurred net losses in Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2013. We may incur net 
losses in the future and we cannot assure you that we will achieve or 
sustain profitability. 
Increases in the prices of, or reductions in the availability of, top-
quality beef could reduce our operating margins and revenue. 
We purchase substantial quantities of beef, particularly Angus Beef® (and 
its equivalent in Brazil), which is subject to significant price 
fluctuations due to conditions affecting livestock markets, weather, feed 
prices, industry demand and other factors. Our meat costs accounted for 
approximately 59% of our total food and beverage costs in the United States 
during 2013, approximately 57% during 2014 and approximately 58% 
during the thirteen weeks ended March 29, 2015. Because our restaurants in 
the United States feature Angus Beef®, we generally would expect to 
purchase this type of beef even in the face of significant price increases. 
If the price for beef increases in the future and we choose not to pass, or 
cannot pass, these increases on to our guests, our operating margins could 
decrease significantly. In addition, if key beef items become unavailable 
for us to purchase, our revenue could decrease. 
We may experience higher operating costs, including increases in supplier 
prices and employee salaries and benefits, which could 
adversely affect our financial performance. 
Our ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our restaurants 
depends, in part, upon our ability to acquire fresh food products, 
including Angus Beef® (and its equivalent in Brazil), and related items from 
reliable sources in accordance with our specifications and in sufficient 
quantities. We have pricing agreements in place with a few suppliers for our 
beef purchases in the United States and short term contracts with a 
limited number of suppliers for the distribution of our other food purchases 
and other supplies for our restaurants. We do not have any supply
