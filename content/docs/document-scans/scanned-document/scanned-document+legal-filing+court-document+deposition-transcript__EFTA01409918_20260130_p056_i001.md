Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
We are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax 
issues in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in 
Brazil, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in those 
jurisdictions. 
As a multinational organization that operates in several jurisdictions, 
including the United States and Brazil, we may be subject to taxation in 
jurisdictions with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which 
can be uncertain. The tax positions that we have taken or may take in the 
future may be subject to challenge on audit, and the authorities in these 
jurisdictions, including Brazil, could successfully assert that we are 
obligated to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties. In addition, the 
amount of taxes we pay could increase substantially as a result of changes 
in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax 
laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which 
could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. 
The authorities could also claim that various withholding requirements 
apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are 
not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material 
impact on us and the results of our operations. 
Brazilian economic, political and other conditions, and Brazilian government 
policies or actions in response to these conditions, may 
negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial 
performance, as well as the market price of our common stock. 
The Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent and occasionally 
extensive intervention by the Brazilian government and unstable 
economic cycles. The Brazilian government has often changed monetary, 
taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the course of the 
country's economy. For example, the government's actions to control 
inflation have at times involved setting wage and price controls, imposing 
exchange controls and limiting imports into Brazil. Additionally, in March 
and April of 2615, a series of protests began in Brazil against the current 
government and President. The initial protests occurred in cities throughout 
Brazil, including in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo, on March 15, with 
protestors generally reported to number around a million, and continued 
throughout the remainder of March and into April. We have no control 
over, and cannot predict, what policies or actions the Brazilian government 
may take in the future, including in response to recent protesting 
activities. These factors, as well as uncertainty over whether the Brazilian 
government may implement changes in policy or regulations relating to 
these factors, could adversely affect us and our business, results of 
operations, financial performance and the market price of our common stock. 
We cannot predict what policies may be implemented by the Brazilian federal 
or state governments and whether these policies will negatively 
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and 
prospects. 
Our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may 
be adversely affected by exchange control policies, interest rates, 
liquidity of domestic capital and lending markets, social and political 
instability, and other economic, political, diplomatic and social
