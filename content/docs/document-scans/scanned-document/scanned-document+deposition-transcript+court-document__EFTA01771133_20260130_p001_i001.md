Re: GIV 
The feeling I got from Ron, the director of maintenance, (he's been th=re 12 years and knows the company pretty well,. 
Ron told me they where=20 getting low ball offers in 5M to 5.7 range when they first listed at "make=20 offer" they 
didn't even respond to these offers. 
Since the board of trus=ees is making the decision, Ron mentioned they don't want to give the plan= away, however the 
CFO is trying to cancel the data base subscriptions, and =o company personal is able to use the plane, it was the 
chairman's own aircraft,.so the plane is just sitting at this point,. 
--- I think a 6M offer is the right number to start, and purchase=20 6.2M, maybe, its obvious they would take 6.5M to 
close, in my opinion. 
= know we will hit them hard during prebuy, my gut tells me a 250K perbuy to=20 seller to repair airworthy items, 
corrosion I spotted on spoiler boards, an= usually will find delamination on engine cowls, if we have Gulfs=ream 
complete the prebuy, I'm sure they pick the plane apart in our favor, along=with Sean recommendations on ASC's 
(Aircraft Service Change's) not mandatory but=some are very good improvements that Gulfstream publishes and 
refinements to any=and all systems operation. 
Ken Hart The Broker from Welch aviation is checking on price and=20 whether it is beneficial to seller to close before 
Jan 1st„ I should =ave that answer in the morning,. 
I will sent more photos in next email,. 
budget numbers: Great Paint job: $140,000 -for starters, Plane Perfect Interior shop, Former Jet Aviation interi=r guys, 
formed their own company when Jet Aviation closed their interior shop, located in West Palm beach. Plane Perfect 
installed Boeing Carpet, and complete interior install and rem=val of Boeing's interior, very capable compay, they 
charge $6,000 per captain chair for new leather, and 515,00= for new foam and fabric on Divan., thx larry
