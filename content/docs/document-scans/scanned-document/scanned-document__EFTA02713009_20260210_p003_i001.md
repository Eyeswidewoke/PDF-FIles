VAGUS NERVE 
FIG. I. Whole-organ indirect immunohistochemistry. The esophagus. stomach, and proximal duodenum were reacted with rabbit polyckmal HSV-I antiserum 
(Dako) and then with perosidase substrate 3.3.-diaminobauidine tetrahydrochloride as described in reference IS. FISV-l-infected areas are identified by dark staining. 
(A to CI Tissue from a BAUM mouse 6 days after oral inoculation with I ISV-1 strain 17 4. (A) Dorsal sieve of the stomach, with the attached esophagus and duodenum, 
showing virus infection in penetrating gastric nerves and the body of the stomach and a concentration of infection in the prepyloric region. (B and Cy Enlarged views 
of the pstroluodenal junction. The arrows point to infected mycnteric ganglia and internodal fibers within the gastric antrum. In panel C (a New along the greater 
curvature ante stomach), infected penetrating nerves are apparent in the mesenteric attachment of the ShIlitath and proximal duodenum. (0) At 8 days p.i. with IISV.1 
strain 17 r. the esophagus of a SOD mouse has widespread viral infection in mycnteric ganglia and interconnecting fibers. Also shown are infected fibers of the vagus 
nerve. 
present study, using immunohistochemistry, we further char-
acterize the spread of HSV-1 within neurons of the gut wall. 
We show that after the placement of HSV-1 into the esopha-
geal lumen of mice, the virus spreads via intemodal strands of 
the enteric nervous system, infecting neurons of the myenteric, 
submucosal, and periglandular plexuses of the esophagus, 
stomach, and duodenum, without significant spread to sur-
rounding tissues. HSV-I-labeled terminal nerve fibers were 
also seen penetrating into the lamina propria of the gastric and 
duodenal mucosa to interact directly with surface epithelial 
cells. These new findings in immunocompetent hosts indicate 
that HSV-1, previously not considered an cntcric pathogen, 
spreads considerably within all levels of the enteric nervous 
system, including nerve fibers directly in contact with the mu-
cosal epithelium. This discovery raises questions regarding a 
possible role for HSVs in inflammatory mucosal and functional 
disorders of the human gastrointestinal tract. 
HSV-1 Infects enteric ganglia after oral inoculation. In a 
previously published study of immunocompetent BALB/c mice 
orally inoculated with neurovirulent HSV-1 strain 17+. in-
fected myenteric ganglia were seen in the esophagus and stom-
ach 4 days postinoculation (p.i.). By immunohistochemistry 
with thin tissue sections (5 to 6 pm), these infected ganglia 
were found to represent a small percentage of the total ganglia 
examined; no infected epithelial cells were apparent (17). Fur-
ther work with a severely attenuated HSV-I strain (in 1814) 
in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficiency 
(SCID) mice again showed a limited propensity for the virus to 
infect mucosal epithelial cells, despite widespread persistent 
infection of neurons and support cells in the enteric nervous 
system. These hosts were unable to clear the primary acute 
infection, and yet even in the absence of specific host immu-
nity, viral spread in these animals was limited primarily to cells 
of the enteric and vagal parasympathetic nervous system (18). 
In the present study, in order to better visualize viral spread 
in the gut, we used a high-titer inoculum of wild-type strains F 
or 17+ and applied the technique of whole-organ immunohis-
tochemistry to further analyze the entire esophagus, stomach, 
and proximal duodenum after intracsophageal inoculation. As 
described elsewhere (18), this technique allows gross detection 
of viral protein expression sites in intact tissues with the aid of 
a dissecting microscope. Immunostained sites can then be se-
lected for further histological examination. Controls, consist-
ing of uninfected tissues, and acutely HSV-I-infected tissues 
processed without primary HSV-1 antiserum were consistently 
negative. 
BALB/c mice received either 1 x 10° 
= 13), 3 x 10° (n 
= 15). or 5 x 10° (n = 3) PFU of wild-type IISV-1 strain 17+ 
or F in 200 µI of serum-free medium delivered by intraesoph-
ageal cannulation as previously described (18). HSV-1 immu-
nostaining was first apparent in fibers of the cervical, thoracic. 
and abdominal portion of the vagus nerve beginning 4 days p.i. 
With polyclonal HSV-I antiserum (Dako, Carpinteria, Calif.) 
being used, virus-infected nerve fibers were visible along the
