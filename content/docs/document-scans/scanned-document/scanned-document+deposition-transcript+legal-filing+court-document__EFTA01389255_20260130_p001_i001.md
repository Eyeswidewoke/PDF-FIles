This confidential private placement memorandum (as amended or supplemented from time to time. this 
"Memorandum') is furnished on a confidential basis by iCapital Advisors, LLC or an affiliate (the "Investment 
Manager') to a limited number of sophisticated investors ("Investors') for the purpose of providing certain 
information about an investment in limited partner interests (the "Interests') in Glendower Access Secondary 
Opportunities IV (U.S.), L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Access Fund'). The Access Fund expects 
to invest substantially all of its assets in Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV, LP, an English 
private fund limited partnership (together with its parallel funds and alternative investment vehicles, if 
applicable, the "Underlying Fund'). 
The Confidential Private Placement Memorandum of the Underlying Fund datcd October 2017 (as supplemented 
by the Supplement to the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated November 2017 and as may be 
amended, restated and/or further supplemented from time to time, the "Underlying Fund PPM-) is attached 
hereto on a confidential basis as Appendix A and is incorporated herein by reference. The investment and 
business objective of the Access Fund is to acquire a direct limited partner interest in the Underlying Fund. The 
Underlying Fund PPM is an integral part of this Memorandum, therefore, prospective investors should carefully 
read the Underlying Fund PPM. This Memorandum is qualified in its entirety by the Underlying Fund PPM and 
the limited partnership agreement of the Underlying Fund (as may be amended or otherwise supplemented from 
time to time, the "Underlying Fund LPA'), which shall be provided upon request by Glendower Access 
Secondary Opportunities IV GP LLC (the "General Partner") or Investment Manager. In the event of any 
conflict or inconsistency between such reference or terms described in this Memorandum relating to the 
Underlying Fund and the Underlying Fund PPM, the Underlying Fund PPM shall control. In the event of any 
conflict or inconsistency between such reference or terms described in the Underlying Fund PPM and the 
Underlying Fund LPA, the Underlying Fund LPA shall control. Neither the Interests nor the interests in the 
Underlying Fund have been recommended, approved or disapproved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the "SEC'), or by any other U.S. federal or state securities commission, regulatory authority, or 
any non-U.S. securities commission or regulatory authority. Furthennom, the foregoing authorities have not 
confirmed the accuracy or determined the adequacy of this Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary 
may be a criminal offense. 
Neither the Interests nor the interests in the Underlying Fund have been registered under the U.S. Securities Act 
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any U.S. state or the securities laws of any 
other country or jurisdiction, nor is such registration contemplated. The Interests will be offered and sold in the 
U.S. in reliance upon the exemptions provided in the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder 
and other exemptions of similar import in the laws of the states and jurisdictions where the offering will be made, 
and in compliance with any applicable U.S. state or other securities laws. The Interests may not be sold or 
transferred (i) except as permitted under the Partnership Agreement and (ii) in compliance with all applicable 
U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. securities laws and any contractual restrictions imposed by the Underlying Fund. 
It is not expected that the Interests or the interests in the Underlying Fund will be registered under the Securities 
Act, or any other securities laws. Neither the Access Fund nor the Underlying Fund will be registered as an 
investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company 
Act'). Consequently, investors will not be afforded the protections of the Investment Company Act. The 
Interests are being offered pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 
Each investor must be a U.S. person that is (x) an "accredited investor- as defined within the meaning of 
Rule 50I(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, (y) a "qualified purchaser-  as defined in 
Section 2(aX51) of the Investment Company Act and (z) a "qualified client," as defined in the U.S. Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act'). There is no public market for the Interests, and no 
such market is expected to develop in the future. Neither the General Partner nor the Investment Manager is 
authorized or expected to become authorized under the European Union's Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative 
Investment Fund Managers (the "AIFM Directive') as of the date of this Memorandum, and the substantive 
requirements applicable to an authorized "Alternative Investment Fund Manage?' ("AIFM') under the AIFM 
Directive or any national implementing law arc not applicable to the General Partner or the Investment Manager. 
Neither the General Partner nor the Investment Manager will market interests (or permit interests to be marketed 
on their behalf) to any prospective investor located, resident or domiciled or with a registered office in or
