CLAIMS RESOLUTION 
Most customer concerns can be resolved by calling our Customer Service Department at the number listed 
on the back of your card. In the event Customer Service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, 
this section explains how claims can be resolved through mediation, arbitration or litigation. It includes an 
arbitration provision. You may reject the arbitration provision by sending us written notice within 45 
days after your first card purchase, or by February 15, 2013, whichever is later. See Your Right to 
Reject Arbitration below. 
For this section. you and us includes any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or 
entities. Claim means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to your Account(s), this 
Agreement, or any agreement or relationship you have or had with us, except for the validity, enforceability or 
scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to: (1) initial claims, counterclaims, 
crossclaims and third-party claims; (2) claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common 
law and equity; (3) claims by or against any third party using or providing any product, service or benefit in 
connection with any account; and (4) claims that arise from or relate to (a) any account created under any of 
the agreements, or any balances on any such account, (b) advertisements, promotions or statements related 
to any accounts. goods or services financed under any accounts or terms of financing, (c) benefits and 
services related to card membership (including fee-based or free benefit programs, enrollment services and 
rewards programs) and (d) your application for any account. You may not sell, assign or transfer a claim. 
Sending a Claim Notice 
Before beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and we agree to send a written notice (a claim 
notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the 
claim informally or through mediation. Go to americanexpress.com/claim for a sample claim notice. The 
claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. Notice to you may be provided 
by your billing statement or sent to your billing address. Notice to us must include your name, address and 
Account number and be sent to American Express ADR do CT Corporation System. 111 8th Ave., NY, NY 
10011. If the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be 
disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules. 
Mediation 
In mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but 
helps parties reach agreement. 
Before beginning mediation. you or we must first send a claim notice. Within 30 days after sending or 
receiving a claim notice, you or we may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com) or the 
American Arbitration Association (AAA") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org) for mediation. We will pay the fees of 
the mediator. 
All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All 
applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. Either you or we may 
terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect 
your or our right to elect arbitration.
