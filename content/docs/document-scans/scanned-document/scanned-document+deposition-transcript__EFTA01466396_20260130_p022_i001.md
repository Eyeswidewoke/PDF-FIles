GEM Equity Strategy Outlook 2014 
3E Mexico; This remains overweight largely because it is one of the few 
GEM constituents where governance is clearly moving in a positive 
direction, in sharp contrast to its Latam peers, Chile and Brazil. Still, 
whilst reforms to the oil sector and labour market should raise the 
level of sustainable economic growth over the longer term, the more 
immediate impact on the margins of many of the listed companies will 
be negative. Mexican equities are clearly expensive at current levels to 
an extent which leaves little room for positive absolute returns over 
the medium term, but in default of any compelling alternatives, we 
remain overweight. 
Poland; Poland is one of the few emerging equity markets to deliver a 
positive total return in dollar terms over 2013 at the time of writing, 
despite the partial nationalisation of the pension fund industry which 
has absorbed the majority of investors' attention over recent months. 
Poland still appears to be relatively low risk/low reward compared to 
the rest of GEM given that financial flows from the EU are likely to 
meet the domestic funding deficit, while the equity market still yields 
just under 4%. Our main fundamental reservation concerns the 
potential for the government to meddle further in the management of 
some of the state-controlled companies which comprise the 
overwhelming majority of MSCI Poland, but we intend to remain 
overweight for the time-being. 
3E Turkey; This is by far the least successful of our recommendations for 
2013 because both equities and the currency fell precipitously during 
the taper scare from late May to August, with only a partial recovery 
since then. We have three reasons for clinging on to our overweight 
position. First, valuations now look more reasonable, especially in the 
dominant financial sector. Second, we are sceptical about the extent 
and the impact of potential tapering, while we believe that the current 
account could benefit from a decline in the oil price. Finally, the major 
problems in Turkey are essentially cyclical — while the AKP-led 
government under PM Erdogan has made some unhelpful statements 
and the geopolitical situation in the area surrounding Turkey has been 
noisy to say the least, the private sector has largely been left to get on 
with business without the same level of state interference or 
negligence visible in some other emerging economies. 
Neutral/overweight 
g 
India; We do not really have a strong view on Indian equities at the 
current level in front of the nationwide elections in May. Valuations 
may appear cheap by historical standards, but are probably just fair, 
given the extent to which growth prospects have deteriorated over the 
past three years. The election is of course vital not so much in terms of 
who wins, but more how they win; in other words, will Congress, or 
more likely the BJP, be able to assemble a coalition which is able to 
enact and more importantly implement the economic reforms which 
investors and the policy-making elite alike deem necessary to restore 
India's growth potential? We suspect that at current levels, a marketfriendly
