securities which are senior to such obligations and as a consequence are 
extremely sensitive to the delinquency and loss performance of the 
underlying assets. Any such losses and other shortfalls with respect to the 
Collateral Obligations will be borne first by the holders of the 
Subordinated Notes and then by the holders of the Notes then outstanding in 
their reverse order of the seniority of such classes of Notes. Further, the 
rate at which principal payments will be received on the Notes will be 
dependent on the rate of payments on the underlying debt and may fluctuate 
significantly over time. Such fluctuations will affect the yield to the 
Issuer, as holder of such debt obligations which in turn may affect the 
Issuer's ability to make timely payments on the Notes. 
Due diligence on Collateral Obligations. Investors will not have the right 
to obtain from Barclays Bank PLC or any of its affiliates or any other 
Transaction party information about the Collateral Obligations, the 
underlying obligors in respect thereof or the Issuer. Consequently, 
investors shall be responsible for performing their own initial and ongoing 
due diligence and investigation of the Portfolio, the Collateral Obligations 
and the Issuer. 
Default Rates. Reliable sources of statistical information may not exist 
with respect to the default rates for the type of debt obligations 
represented by the Portfolio. Moreover, the available information may not be 
indicative of future performance. Should increases in default rates occur 
with respect to the types of debt obligations comprising the 
Portfolio, the actual default rates of the Collateral Obligations may exceed 
the hypothetical default rates used in the performance tables shown herein. 
Prospective investors in the Notes should consider and determine for 
themselves the likely level of defaults and the level and timing of 
recoveries on the Collateral Obligations during the term of the Transaction. 
Loan Participations. The Issuer will have the ability to purchase a limited 
amount of loan participations. In purchasing loan participations, the Issuer 
will usually have a contractual relationship only with the selling 
institution, and not the borrower. The Issuer generally will have no right 
directly to enforce compliance by the borrower. The insolvency of or other 
events pertaining to the selling institution may delay or reduce payments to 
the Issuer. The Issuer is thereby subject to the credit risk associated with 
not only the obligor on the loan but also the selling institution. 
Reinvestment Risk. There can be no assurance that, in the event collateral 
prepays or is sold, spreads prevailing at such time will be at the same 
levels as they were when that collateral was purchased. To the extent 
prepaid or sold collateral is reinvested into lower spread assets, the 
interest available to make payments on the Notes may be adversely affected. 
Since senior bank loans generally can be prepaid without penalty and are 
more likely to prepay than bonds, the impact of the foregoing risk factor 
may be heightened with respect to the collateral consisting of senior loans. 
Moreover the average anticipated maturity of senior loans to be acquired may 
be less than the reinvestment period. In the event that holders of the Notes 
are paid principal of their Notes earlier than expected, they may not be
