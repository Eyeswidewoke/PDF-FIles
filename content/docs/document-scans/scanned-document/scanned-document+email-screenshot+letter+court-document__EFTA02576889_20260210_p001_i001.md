Re: MDF 
Ari, 
sorry for the slight delay until I got around to answering your latest =ail. The discussion is very interesting and inspiring 
to me! With respect to our original discussion of intelligence with respect to =ooperation, competition and deception, it 
is mostly tangential (all =ecipients, please be warned, we spun off towards the metaphysics of =1). 
> While I think the notion of functionalism stands as a thought 
> =xperiment, building equivalent systems that "perform exactly the same =unction" as the original is pretty elusive. I 
remember hearing from a =esearcher at UW trying to build a mechanical finger to study human =ovement for cybernetic 
purposes. (...) The value I see in the essentialist approach is that natural, evolved =ystems use all the subtlety, the 
complexity of their medium. The neat =pproach keeps trying to add complexity until epsilon hits zero on its =ntegral. 
But isn't a zero epsilon actually asymptotical outside of the =lean confines of math? Or at least elusive (in this arena) 
until we =ctually understand what level of physical reality that neurons are =ssentially operating in? 
I do not think of functionalism as a recipe to build something, but as =n epistemological position. Functionalism 
recognizes that we construct =ur concepts (including the concept of mind and intelligence) based on =hat things do, not 
on what they 'essentially' are. A mind is not an =ntrinsic power animated by a soul with no empirical properties, but a 
=ausal arrangement that processes information in such a way that it is =ble to participate in discourse, control a body, 
reflect upon itself, =ind creative solutions, imagine and dream, and so on. I do not suggest =o reduce any of these 
properties away, but to focus on the right level. 
This level is not the neural level, for instance. I suspect that look =olely at neurons would be akin to explain flight by 
looking at =eathers, instead of aerodynamics. Chances are that we learn things from =eathers, but we will also be 
intimidated by the trillions of tiny stems =hat interconnect them in intricate ways, etc., and if we replicate =hem, 
chances are that we end up with a penguin. In other words, I =uggest looking at what functions neurons compute, and 
how that =ontributes to the set of abilities that we want to replicate and/or =nderstand. 
> It feels like the scruffy vs. neat tension again (out of curiosity, =here you do place yourself on that spectrum, Joscha?). 
I am pragmatic. I suspect that nature is mostly scruffy (but not =ntirely so, a lot of our physiology is very clear-cut), and 
that there =re limits to both a completely scruffy and especially an entirely neat =pproach. 
» Most computer scientists are computationalists by instinct: to us, =verything is a computer program in some sense. 
(Physics, for instance, =s the endeavor to find a possible implementation that could produce all =nown observable 
phenomena.) Most other people on the planet, including suite a few philosophers, are not. To them, the idea of 
"reducing" =ind and universe to regular and stochastic changes in patterns of =nformation (aka computation) might 
even sound offensive. 
> Hah. I guess I never thought of just how weird that makes us to the =est of the world, but yes. Without the 
supernatural (which seems to =acking in any sort of proof), any other conclusion is absurd.
