depends upon the choice of gauge in which the calculation is 
performed [27, 28), and care must be taken to extract gauge-
invariant observables from it [29-32] (see also [33, 34]). This 
fact can perhaps be understood most directly by recalling 
that the effective action is the generating functional for one-
particle irreducible Green's functions, which themselves arc 
gauge dependent [28]. In practice one often neglects this sub-
tlety, fixes the gauge at the start of the calculation, and cal-
culates observables with the effective potential as if it were a 
classical potential. In the context of finite temperature phase 
transitions. it is known that when calculated naively in this 
way, the predictions for observables depend on the choice of 
gauge used I 34—all. Because of the extreme tension between 
HI models and the data, we assess here the degree to which 
this gauge uncertainty might affect the observables in Higgs 
Inflation. We find that the gauge ambiguity introduces uncer-
tainties that are comparable to the variation of the physical 
parameters, i.e. the Higgs mass. As a result. this ambiguity 
alone cannot resuscitate moribund models. 
2, GRAVITY WAVES FROM HIGGS INFLATION 
The Standard Model Higgs potential, V(h) = Ah4/4 with 
A = O(0.1), is too steeply sloped for successful inflation. 
The measurement of the Higgs boson mf.. fixes A 
0.13, 
whereas A a 1 is required to produce the observed ampli-
tude of density perturbations. In the HI model, slow roll is 
achieved by introducing a non-minimal gravitational coupling 
for the Higgs field. C = 
ciblibR. where (ff is the Higgs dou-
blet and R the Ricci scalar. One can remove the non-minimal 
coupling term from the Lagrangian by performing a confor-
mal transformation, go,„(x) = 51-2(x)li,„(s) where 
D2 = 1 + 2e(}141/4/1, 
(2) 
is the conformal factor and My is the reduced Planck mass. 
By doing so. one passes from the Jordan to the Einstein frame. 
The scalar potential in the new frame becomes 
V(h) =
2
 
(3) 
4 (1 + 
where we have written 4.147, = h2/ 2. At large field values. 
h > ii/p/VZ, the potential asymptotes to a constant 
Vo s AMP/4e2 
(4) 
This is the appropriate regime for slow roll inflation. 
To evince the tension between Higgs Inflation and large ten-
sor perturbations we can first neglect quantum corrections to 
V(h), e.g. the running of A, as the energy scale of HI, given 
by Eq. (4), is insensitive to the quantum corrections, whereas 
the slope is more sensitive. 
Since A is fixed by the measured Higgs mass, the scalar 
potential in Eq. (3) has only one free parameter: 4. It is well-
known that to achieve sufficient e-foldings of inflation and the 
correct amplitude for the scalar power spectrum, one needs the 
non-minimal coupling to be much larger than unity. Specifi-
cally one requires (see, e.g., Ref. [81) 
4 st 47000v5 
(5) 
which is e 
17000 for A .c.,7 0.13. The energy scale of infla-
tion is then predicted to be 
14 :v. (0.79 x 1016 GeV)4 
(6) 
leading to a tensor-to-scalar ratio, assume scalar density per-
turbations fixed by CMB observations, r •co-- 0.0036. This is 
naively incompatible with the much larger BICEP2 measure-
ment, see Eq. (I). Decrease in HI to attempt to match the 
newly measured value of %1,,r is not workable either, as set-
ting e 
2000 then produces too little power in scalar density 
perturbations. 
Fundamentally then, the problem in obtaining a large value 
of r in Higgs inflationary models is that the HI potential 
asymptotes to a constant at large field values where inflation 
occurs. This flat potential then results in relatively large den-
sity perturbations, which, in order to then match observations, 
constrain the magnitude of the potential, resulting in a small 
tensor contribution. 
The question then becomes whether variations in this 
canonical HI, due to quantum effects for example, will allow 
the SM Higgs boson to the be inflaton field while also accom-
modating the large value of r. 
3. SAVING HIGGS INFLATION? 
Since it is the non-minimal coupling, e, that flattens out the 
potential at high scales, one might consider whether there are 
other ways to flatten the potential, and so avoid the require-
ment for large e values. 
One possibility proposed in this regard [I 3] involves fine 
tuning the Higgs and top masses such that the Higgs self-
coupling runs very small at the scale of inflation, A 
10-4. 
This allows for relatively small e — 90 and produces r > 0.15 
that may be compatible with the BICEP measurement. It is 
impossible to entirely eliminate the need for the non-minimal 
coupling. However, as a caveat let us point out that this so-
lution only exists if the theory is first quantized in the Jordan 
frame and then moved to the Einstein frame (so-called "pre-
scription I"), and results differ if the operations are reversed 
("prescription II"). The apparent disagreement is an artifact 
of quantizing all the fields except gravity, which results in a 
different definition of the Ricci scalar in the two frames. A 
full theory of quantum gravity would probably be required to 
resolve the problem consistently between frames. Thus, it is 
not clear if the small £ "prescription I" solution is artificial. 
If one goes outside of the Standard Model, then new physics 
can affect the running of the Higgs self-coupling or anomalous 
dimension, y. For example, one may hope that A or -) acquires 
a significant running at high scales so as to give a workable 
solution consistent with both the measured scalar and tensor 
power spectra. (See. e.g., [4 1).
