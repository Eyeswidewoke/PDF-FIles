Dally Tax Report 
Additional cases with similar results and rationales indude Kom Industries, Inc. v. United States, 532 
F.2d 1352 (Ct. Cl. 1976)(holding that taxpayer did not change its accounting method when it included 
three previously omitted classes of costs in finished good inventory because this was consistent with 
how taxpayer treated similar items in that class of expenditures. But see, Rev. Rul. 77-134, 1977-1 
C.B. 132), ThompsonKing-Tate, (holding that changes to correct the application of taxpayers existing 
completed contract method to a new contract were not an accounting method change), and Northern 
States Power (holding that a change from capitalizing losses on nudear fuel contracts to deducting 
such losses as incurred was not a change in accounting method because the taxpayer was deducting 
losses on other fuel contracts as Incurred). 
The divergent treatment as error cases have become anomalies and anachronisms within the law of 
IRC § 446 in several crucial respects. 
First, the divergent treatment as error cases rely heavily upon the proposition that the consent of the 
Commissioner under IRC § 446(e) is not required where the taxpayers existing treatment is 
improper. This proposition is expressly rejected by Treas. Reg. § 1.446-1(e)(2)(i), which provides in 
part that consent to change an existing accounting method "must be secured whether or not such 
method is proper or is permitted under the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder." 
See also Treas. Reg. § 1.446-1(e)(2)00), Examples (6)-(8), Rev. Rul. 80-190, 1980-2 C.B. 161, Rev. Rul. 
77134. The vast majority of judldal opinion agrees that IRC § 446(e) consent is required even for 
improper treatments. See, for example, O. Liquidating v. Commissioner , 292 F.2d 225, 230-31 (3rd 
Cir. 1961), Wright Contracting Co. v. Commissioner, 316 F.2d 249, 254 (5th Cir. 1963), Witte, 513 F.2d 
at 393-95, Wayne Nut and Bolt, 93 T.C. at 51; Diebold, Helmsley v. U.S., 941 F.2d 71, 87 (2nd Cir. 
1991), Pacific Enterprises,101 T.C. at 23; Convergent Technologies, Inc., v. Commissioner, T. C. Memo. 
1995-320, Rankin v. Commissioner, 138 F.3d 1286, 1289 (9th Cir. 1998). 
Second, the divergent treatment as error cases rely on the proposition that conforming the divergent 
treatment to the primary accounting method is not a change in accounting method because the 
necessary adjustments have not altered the primary accounting method for the item; rather, the 
adjustments merely apply the primary accounting method across the item on a correct and uniform 
basis. See Northern States Power, 151 F.3d at 884-885, Korn, 532 F.2d at 1355-1356, Beacon 
Publishing Co. v. Commissioner, 218 F.2d 697, 702 (10th Cir. 1955). This proposition is overly broad 
and simplistic because It neglects the critical analytical test required by IRC § 446(e), that is, is the 
divergent treatment a material Item (a timing practice applied on a consistent basis)? If the divergent 
treatment is not a material item, it constitutes an error (or group of errors); if the divergent treatment 
is a material Item, then a change in the treatment of such material item is an accounting method 
change under IRC § 446. See Treas. Reg. § 1.446-1(e)(2)(ii)(a), Huffman, 126 T.C. at 354-355. 
Third, the divergent treatment as error cases rely upon the argument that a divergent treatment 
cannot be a "material item" because by its very nature a divergent treatment applies to only a portion 
of an item; the remainder of the item remains subject to the primary accounting method. This 
argument finds no support in the regulations, which define material item as "any item that involves 
the proper time for the inclusion of the item in income or the taking of a deduction." Treas. Reg. 
§ 1.446-1(e)(2)(ii)(a). Further, the case law has generally concluded that the pertinent inquiry for 
determining whether timing is involved is whether the accounting practice permanently affects the 
taxpayers lifetime income or merely changes the tax year in which taxable income is reported. See 
Primo Pants, Knight Ridder, Peoples Bank & Trust. In other words, the lynchpin for determining 
whether an accounting practice is a "material item" is timing _ and the presence or absence of timing 
in an accounting practice is completely unrelated to how widely or narrowly the accounting practice is 
applied. Accordingly, the inquiry into whether a divergent treatment applies to an entire item or only a 
portion of an item tells us nothing about whether conforming the divergent treatment to the primary 
accounting method would be an accounting method change because the inquiry tells us nothing 
about whether the divergent treatment involves timing. 
Fourth, the divergent treatment as error cases are incompatible with the existence of hybrid 
accounting methods and related accounting method changes as recognized in IRC § 446(c). Subject 
to certain limitations, any combination of accounting methods is permitted in connection with a trade 
or business If such combination dearly reflects income and is consistently used. See Treas. Reg. 
§ 1.446-1(c)(1)(iv)(a). Further, changes to or from a hybrid accounting method, or between one hybrid 
method and another, are changes in accounting method. This is clearly illustrated by Example (2) of 
Treas. Reg. § 1.446-1(e)(2)(iii), which states that a taxpayer that uses an overall accrual accounting 
method but uses the cash receipts and disbursements method for a single item (real estate taxes) 
requires consent under IRC § 446(e) to change its treatment of real estate taxes to the accrual 
method. 
The condusions of Example 2 of Treas. Reg. § 1.446-1(e)(2)(iii) were echoed by the Tax Court in
