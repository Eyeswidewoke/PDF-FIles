"curtly responded," "No, I will not." Later in the hearing, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) asked "what's 
the harm" in restoring the machines. DeJoy "didn't want to entertain the question, arguing 
Congress would not be able to give the USPS a billion dollars, let alone the $10 billion Mr. 
Khanna was referencing." DeJoy said, "Get me the billion and I'll put the machines in." 
The Washington Examiner (8/24, Ferrechio, 448K) says Democrats "suggested that DeJoy 
is breaking the law by slowing mail in a way that could influence the Nov. 3 election." Rep. Jim 
Cooper (D-TN) "told DeJoy it's a felony to tamper with the mail," and "compared DeJoy to Roger 
Stone, a former associate of Trump's whose prison sentence for lying to Congress was 
commuted by the president." Cooper said, "Are your mail delays implicit campaign 
contributions? Is your backup plan to be pardoned like Roger Stone," to which DeJoy replied, 
"Pitiful. Not worth a comment." 
Townhall (8/24, O'Brien, 177K) reports that DeJoy "corrected conspiracy theories that 
suggested he's helping to rig the November general election to help President Trump's re-
election." Oversight Committee ranking member Rep. James Comer (R-KY) "offered DeJoy an 
assist by uprooting some of those same Democratic talking points." Comer said, "The blue 
boxes and mail sorters were both components of longstanding programs in response to 
significant reduction in mail volume. ... A 33% reduction over the past 15 years." Townhall 
adds, "Both DeJoy and Comer reiterated the fact that the Postal Service is more than capable of 
handling mail in ballots this fall and that the Democrat-led emergency funding bill that passed 
on Friday was highly unnecessary." The CBS Evening NewsVi (8/24, story 4, 0:25, O'Donnell, 
4.21M) provided similar coverage in a brief report. 
Trump: Democrats Using Hearings To Blame GOP For Fraud That Will Occur With 
Mail-In Ballots. Trump tweeted Monday morning, "All the Radical Left Democrats are trying 
to do with the Post Office hearings is blame the Republicans for the FRAUD that will occur 
because of the 51 Million Ballots that are being sent to people who have not even requested 
them. They are setting the table for a BIG MESS!" 
Pelosi Calls Trump And His Allies "Enemies Of The State." The Washington Times 
(8/24, Ernst, 492K) reports that on MSNBCVI Monday, House Speaker Pelosi "ratcheted up the 
revolutionary...by calling President Trump and his allies 'domestic enemies' who must be ousted 
from the White House." Pelosi "warned MSNBC viewers that Mr. Trump's opposition to a sudden 
push for mail-in voting systems was tantamount to a Constitutional crisis." She said, "We take 
an oath to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. And 
sadly, the domestic enemies to our voting system and honoring our Constitution are right at 
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue with their allies in the Congress of the United States." Pelosi added, 
"They're doing everything they can, suppress the vote — with your actions, scare people, 
intimidate by saying law enforcement will be there, diminish the role of the postal system in all 
of this. It's really actually shameful. Enemies of the state." 
Politico Analysis: Schumer Has Shifted Leftward Along With His Party. 
Politico (8/24, Bresnahan, Levine, 4.29M) reports, "With Senate Democrats favored to win 
control of the chamber" this fall, Senate Minority Leader Schumer "is poised to make history. 
He'd be the first Jewish Senate majority leader and the first New Yorker to hold the post. ... Yet 
the Schumer of today is a far cry from the Reagan-era liberal who won election to the House in 
1980 and then embraced the mantle of a 'law-and-order Democrat' when he ran for the Senate 
in 1998. ... Once derided for being too close to Wall Street, Schumer aides now boast that he 
has stood up to the financial services industry." While he "is still distrusted by some on the left," 
Schumer "insists his views have shifted to reflect a different constituency, as well as the more 
progressive Democratic Party of the Donald Trump era." 
Laura Could Be Most Powerful Storm To Hit Gulf Coast Since Katrina, Rita.
