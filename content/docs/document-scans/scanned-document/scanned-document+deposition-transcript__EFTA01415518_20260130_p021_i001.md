methodology as a result of changes in economic conditions, conditions in the 
loan markets or a variety of other factors. A reduction in the ratings of 
the Notes or a Collateral Obligation will have negative consequences to 
holders. A reduction of the ratings of a Note may, for regulated entities, 
cause adverse effects on the value of the Notes as a legal investment or the 
capital treatment of the Notes. 
Possible Withdrawal of Ratings upon Failure to Comply with Rule 17g-5 under 
the Exchange Act. On June 2, 2010, certain amendments to Rule 17g-5 under 
the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC became effective. Amended Rule 17g-5 
requires each rating agency providing a rating of a structured finance 
product such as this transaction paid for by the "arranger" (defined as the 
issuer, the underwriter or the sponsor) to obtain an undertaking from the 
arranger to (i) create a password protected website, (ii) post on that 
website all information provided to the rating agency in connection with the 
initial rating of the Notes and all information provided to the rating 
agency in connection with the surveillance of such rating, in each case, 
contemporaneous with the provision of such information to the applicable 
rating agency and (iii) provide access to such website to other rating 
agencies that have made certain certifications to the arranger regarding 
their use of the information. In this transaction, the "arranger" is the 
Issuer. If the arranger does not comply with its undertakings to any Rating 
Agency with respect to this transaction, such Rating Agency may withdraw its 
ratings of the Notes. The withdrawal of ratings by any Rating Agency may 
adversely affect the price, liquidity and transferability of the Notes and 
may adversely affect any beneficial owner that relies on ratings of 
securities for regulatory or other compliance purposes. 
Under Rule 17g-5, 
rating agencies other than Moody's and S&P that provide the requisite 
certifications described above may issue unsolicited ratings of the Notes 
which may be lower and, in some cases, significantly lower than the ratings 
provided by Moody's and S&P. The unsolicited ratings may be issued prior to, 
on or after the Closing Date and are not reflected herein. Issuance of any 
unsolicited rating will not affect the issuance of the Notes. Such 
unsolicited ratings could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of 
the Notes and, for regulated entities, could adversely affect the value of 
the Notes as a legal investment or the capital treatment of the Notes. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission may determine that one or both of Moody's 
and S&P no longer qualifies as an NRSRO for purposes of the federal 
securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on 
the market prices of the Notes. 
Investment Company Act. The Issuer does not intend to register as an 
investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended, in reliance on the exception provided in Section 3(c)(7) of said 
act. If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to determine that 
the Issuer is required to so register, the Issuer could be subject to an 
enforcement action, the assessment of damages and other negative 
consequences and an Event of Default will occur under the Offering Circular. 
Tax Considerations. Special tax considerations may apply to certain types 
of taxpayers and prospective investors should consider the potential impact
