Save Time Paying Your Bills with the Card 
Enjoy the time-saving convenience of using your Card to pay your 
bills. You can consolidate your payments and make sure your bills 
are paid on time. And you're backed by the security of American 
Express. Contact your providers directly and tell them to charge your 
monthly bills like cable/satellite to your Card. 
Terms and conditions apply. Not all providers service all markets. In some instances it may 
take more than one billing cycle before initial paid amounts are posted to the Card account. 
Please remember to cancel these payments with your service provider if you close your 
Card account, and advise your service provider if your Card account number changes.
