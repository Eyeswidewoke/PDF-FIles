have any material liability or contingent obligation not shown on such 
statements. Since the date of such financial information there has been no 
material adverse change in the financial condition, operations, assets, and 
prospects of Party B. 
(e) 
Set Off. Section 6(f) of this Agreement is deleted in its entirety 
and replaced with the following: 
"(f) 
Upon the designation of any Early Termination Date, the party that 
is not the Defaulting Party or Affected Party ("X") may, without prior 
notice to the Defaulting or Affected Party ("Y"), set off any sum or 
obligation (whether or not arising under this Agreement, whether matured or 
unmatured, whether or not contingent and irrespective of the currency, place 
of payment or booking office of the sum or obligation) owed by Y to X or any 
Affiliate of X (the "X Set Off Amount") against any sum or obligation 
(whether or not arising under this Agreement, whether matured or unmatured, 
whether or not contingent and irrespective of the currency, place of payment 
or booking office of the sum or obligation) owed by X or any Affiliate of X 
to Y (the "Y Set Off Amount"). X will give notice to the other party of any 
set off effected under this Section 6(f). 
For this purpose, either the X Set Off Amount or the Y Set Off Amount (or 
the relevant portion of such set off amounts) may be converted by X into the 
currency in which the other set off amount is denominated at the rate of 
exchange at which X would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good 
faith, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency. 
If a sum or obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that 
obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant 
party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained. 
Nothing in this Section 6(f) shall be effective to create a charge or other 
security interest. This Section 6(f) shall be without prejudice and in 
addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien or other 
rights to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by 
operation of law, contract or otherwise)." 
(f) 
Escrow. On any date on which both parties are required to make 
payments hereunder, either party may at its option and in its sole 
discretion notify the other party that payments on that date are to be made 
in escrow. In this case deposit of the payment due earlier on that date 
shall be made by 2:00 p.m. (local time at the place for the earlier payment 
if there is a time difference between the cities in which payments are to be 
made) on that date with an escrow agent selected by the party giving the 
notice and reasonably acceptable to the other party, accompanied by 
irrevocable payment instructions (i) to release the deposited payment to the 
intended recipient upon receipt by the escrow agent of the required deposit 
of the corresponding payment from the other party on the same date 
accompanied by irrevocable payment instructions to the same effect or (ii) 
if the required deposit of the corresponding payment is not made on that 
same date, to return the payment deposited to the party that paid it into 
escrow at such party's request. The party that elects to have payments made 
in escrow shall pay the costs of the escrow arrangements and shall cause 
those arrangements to provide that the intended recipient of the payment due 
to be deposited first shall be entitled to interest on that deposited 
payment for each day in the period of its deposit at the rate offered by the
