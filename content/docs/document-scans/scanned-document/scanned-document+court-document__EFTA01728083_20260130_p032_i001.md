important artists whose work does not fall within the category of non-objective art. 
1959 The museum opens to an enthusiastic public on October 21, just six months after 
Wright's death. From the beginning, the relationship between the breathtaking 
architecture of the building and the art it was built to display inspires controversy and 
debate. One critic writes that the museum "has turned out to be the most beautiful 
building in America . . never for a minute dominating the pictures being shown,' while 
another Insists that the structure is 'less a museum than it Is a monument to Frank Lloyd 
Wright." 
1961 One year after the resignation of Sweeney, Thomas M. Messer is appointed 
Director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. He will remain in that position for 
twenty-seven years, during which time he greatly expands the collection and establishes 
the Guggenheim as a world-class institution known for its art scholarship and special 
exhibitions. 
1963 The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation receives a major portion of Justin K, 
Thannhauser's renowned personal collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and 
early modern art. Over the years, Thannhauser and his widow, Hilde, will give the 
Guggenheim more than seventy works, including thirty-four by Picasso alone. This 
donation greatly enlarges the scope of the collection to include painting of the nineteenth 
century, beginning with Camille Pissaro's The Hermitage at Pontoises. Under the terms of 
the gift, the Thannhauser Collection is on permanent view at the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum. 
1976 Peggy Guggenheim transfers ownership of her collection to the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Foundation with the understanding that the works of art will remain in 
Venice. Peggy dies In 1979 and the Foundation takes ownership of the palazzo. Thomas 
M. Messer is appointed Director of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in addition to his 
role overseeing the New York museum, and he supervises a major effort to conserve and 
document the Venice holdings. In 1980, Messer is named Director of the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Foundation. 
1988 Thomas Krens succeeds Messer as Director of the Foundation. Krens takes charge 
of an expansion program already underway In New York, which will include an annex 
designed by Gwathmey Siegel and Associates Architects, and Initiates planning for a 
comprehensive restoration of the Wright building. 
1990 The Wright building is closed to the public so that the restoration and expansion 
can begin. Over the next two years, masterpieces from the collection are exhibited In a 
triumphant international tour to Venice, Madrid, Tokyo, Australia. and Montreal. 
1991 Through purchase and gift, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation acquires the 
Panza di Biumo Collection of Minimalist and Conceptual Art. This acquisition dramatically 
enlarges the Foundation's permanent collection, giving it great depth in works by 
American postwar masters Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Robert Ryman, and Richard Serra, 
among others. 
1991-92 Agreements are signed between the Basque Administration and the Solomon 
R. Guggenheim Foundation to create a Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. The 
Basque Administration will fully fund the $100 million construction and will make annual 
contributions to the operating budget. The Foundation will provide curatorial and 
administrative expertise as well as the core art collection and programming. Frank Gehry 
is chosen as the architect of the future museum. The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation 
gives the Guggenheim 200 vintage photographs by Mapplethorpe, as well as a grant to 
launch a photography program. Contemporary photography quickly becomes a major 
area of collecting for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, and within a decade it is 
able to mount major exhibitions based on its holdings. 
1992 After a three-year restoration of its interior, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 
reopens to great acclaim. An eight-story annex, designed by Gwathmey Siegel and 
Associates Architects, opens simultaneously. The Guggenheim Museum Sotio opens. 
During its ten years in operation, the museum, designed by Arata Isozaki, will mount 
many small but important exhibitions focusing on artists such as Max Beckmann, Marc 
Chagall, and Anton' Tholes as well as on art created in new media.
