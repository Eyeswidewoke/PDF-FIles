children,24 a 2.6 relative risk for attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD),25 and a significant risk of hypothalamic-
pituitary dysfunction.36 Developmentally, sensitive care that 
incorporates noise management as well as human contact and 
other "positive" stimuli appear to improve clinical outcome 
and decrease costs associated with inpatient care for prema-
ture infants.22-32
The acoustic environment in which many premature infants 
spend their first days-to-months of life—hospital neonatal 
intensive care units (NICUs) and special care units (SCUs)—
is at once impoverished and chaotic.33 Whether lying in a bas-
sinet or enclosed in a temperature-controlled isolette on 
mechanical-assisted ventilation, hospitalized infants arc 
exposed to little in the way of speech, music, and other etholo-
gically relevant sounds important for normal language and 
social development. Even worse, the sound environment is 
filled with unpredictable, sometimes loud acoustic stimuli 
(eg, alarms indicating a potentially dangerous change in a phy-
siological measure)." The ambient sound level in an NICU can 
reach intensities as high as 90 dB SPL, several-fold louder than 
the ambient intrauterine intensities the infant had been accus-
tomed to (50 dB SPL).35.36 Moreover, NICU sounds contain 
high as well as low frequencies, whereas the intrauterine envi-
ronment only allows low-frequency sounds (less than 250 Hz) 
to reach the infant. Infants born before 36 weeks may be espe-
cially sensitive, and thus vulnerable, to the effects of an impo-
verished, chaotic auditory environment because their auditory 
discrimination capabilities are immamrc,37 and they remain 
unable to visually identify the sources of sound and have lim-
ited exposure to faces and visual scenes in general. The infant's 
heightened auditory sensitivity requires that physicians and 
nurses determine the type, dose, and dose interval of acoustic 
stimuli empirically. What the optimal auditory conditions are, 
and how they could be provided in the NICU environment, 
remain unknown. The American Academy of Pediatrics" and 
the National Association of Neonatal Nurses" have proposed a 
number of procedural and technical strategies to reduce ambi-
ent noise. One study of 30 premature infants showed that wear-
ing earmuffs significantly increased quiet sleep timeo 
Another study of 24 very low birthweight neonates found that 
wearing silicone earplugs significantly increased weight 
gain:" However, there remains the possibility that quiet is sub-
optimal because stimulation with music or other natural sounds 
would promote development while avoiding the potential dele-
terious consequences of decreasing auditory and multimodal 
stimulation (for reviews see Philbin42 and Aucott et al43). Sev-
eral researchers have explored the potential benefits of auditory 
stimulation with music in the NICU environment."'" In their 
recent review, Hartling et a15 found that the researchers have 
used a variety of musical types (eg, vocal vs instrumental, folk 
vs classical), presentation methods (recorded vs live), and 
acoustic environments (eg, music alone vs with intrauterine 
sounds) in the NICU.5 Methodological consideration, as the 
authors point out, preclude a straight forward interpretation 
of how the type of music and its presentation affect physiologi-
cal and behavioral responses. Auditory stimulation, controlled 
with respect to music type, intensity, presentation, dose, and 
dose-interval, could counter the effects on unpredictable noise 
in the NICU environment and promote normal auditory and 
cognitive development via exposure to the language and music 
of the infant's culture. 
Acutely painful stimuli typically cause increases in HR, 
respiration rate, blood pressure, plasma cortisol levels, facial 
grimacing, crying and body movements, and decreases in oxy-
gen saturation (O2-sap:I?" These responses, which could 
reflect an internal state of stress, can be difficult to appreciate 
in the most vulnerable premature infants because their imma-
ture central nervous system precludes their ability to generate 
all the components of a stress response.67•4R Even routine pro-
cedures administered to hospitalized infants have been shown 
to elicit a stress response:It" A recent study of 430 infants 
admitted to NICUs in Paris found that on average, each infant 
received 12 painful procedures daily during their first 2 weeks 
in the NICU 51 In another study, 54 infants admitted to a 
NICU over a 3-month period experienced 3283 invasive pro-
cedures.52 The majority (56%) involved the "heel-stick" (aka 
"heel lance," "heel prick") procedure, a painful method of 
obtaining blood for serologic analyses in which the infant's 
heel is pierced with a sterile needle and squeezed repeatedly 
to express blood through the puncture site. The high meta-
bolic demands of these repeated stressors could decrease 
energy stores available for growth. Moreover, adrenocortical 
responses to repeated stressful stimuli might weaken the 
infant's immune system and increase the risk of illness."'" 
Grunau53 has hypothesized that infants who receive frequent 
medical interventions without "positive" or soothing stimuli 
may develop a low pain threshold or become hypersensitive to 
touch. Recent evidence shows that 3- to 18-month preterm 
babies have abnormal basal cortisol levelsS6 and that 4-
month-old infants have abnormal cortisol responses during 
pain associated with immunizations.S7 Abnormal cortisol lev-
els may be one mechanism by which early pain exposure 
could compromise brain development.55 This, in turn, could 
contribute to learning, attentional, and behavioral problems 
later in childhood." 
Although infants undergo many painful procedures and may 
perceive pain more acutely than do adults, pain management 
for this population is less than optimal 51.594' There is wide 
variation in the use of pharmacological analgesics in N1CUs,62
which increase fluid retention and bilirubin levels and routinely 
raise concerns about CNS depressant effects, including respira-
tory depression. Standardized protocols for nonpharmacologi-
cal analgesia are lacking, and NICU personnel may not be 
adequately trained in pain assessment, management, and pre-
vention.63 A better understanding of nonpharmacological treat-
ments is needed to advance the development of protocols to 
alleviate pain and stress without the risks of potential medica-
tion side efects.33 As a noninvasive, analgesic, and anxiolytic 
intervention, controlled auditory stimulation with music may 
provide a treatment with a high benefit:risk ratio. The present 
study tests the hypothesis that music attenuates physiological 
and behavioral responses to heel stick.
