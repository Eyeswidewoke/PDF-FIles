HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
merger transactions (whether announced or unannounced) (as previously defined, 
"Corporate Events"), in situations in which either (i) the price at which shares eligible for 
an appraisal can be acquired by the Corporate Value Fund in the market or (ii) Hudson 
Bay Capital's analysis indicates that the Transaction Price agreed to between the Target 
and the Acquiror, is below the Fair Value that Hudson Bay Capital believes is likely to be 
determined in an Appraisal Proceeding. 
The Corporate Value Fund will generally not invest in Corporate Events that have not yet 
been publicly announced. However, even in the case of a publicly announced Corporate 
Event, there can be substantial uncertainty as to whether and under what terms such 
Corporate Event will be consummated. 
After an investment in a Corporate Event (a "Corporate Event Investment") has been 
identified and a position established, Hudson Bay Capital may seek to "perfect" the 
Corporate Value Fund's right to be granted an appraisal of its shares in the Target. 
Hudson Bay Capital will base its determination of which Targets to select on Hudson Bay 
Capital's analysis of its legal rights, as well as the economic fundamentals underlying 
each such Target as compared to the proposed Transaction Price. 
Once a Corporate Event is consummated, Hudson Bay Capital may: (i) file an appraisal 
petition (an "Appraisal Petition") in court on behalf of the Corporate Value Fund to begin 
the appraisal process in an attempt to obtain the Fair Value of the Target's securities as 
opposed to the Transaction Price; or (ii) elect not to file, but nevertheless to "perfect" its 
claim to become entitled to receive the Fair Value obtained by the lead plaintiff in an 
Appraisal Proceeding. The process of resolving an appraisal demand (as previously 
defined, an "Appraisal Proceeding") takes an unpredictable amount of time — often as 
long as several years. Hudson Bay Capital may, in certain situations, attempt to agree 
upon a payment for the Corporate Value Fund's holdings in the Target with the Acquiror 
and settle the Corporate Value Fund's interest in the Appraisal Proceeding. The Acquiror 
may also prepay the Transaction Price for all or part of the Target's shares so that interest 
at the statutory rate only accrues on the shortfall, if any, ultimately determined between 
the Transaction Price and the Fair Value. The Corporate Value Fund also may acquire 
perfected appraisal rights from third parties (collectively, "Third-Party Appraisal 
Rights"). 
Hudson Bay Capital may cause the Corporate Value Fund to invest in any Corporate 
Event in which Hudson Bay Capital believes that it is able to identify a sufficient 
shortfall between the Transaction Price and Fair Value, irrespective of diversification 
considerations. Similarly, although Hudson Bay Capital anticipates that most of the 
Appraisal Proceedings the Corporate Value Fund will bring will be in Delaware, the 
Corporate Value Fund is not restricted as to the jurisdiction in which it may bring an 
Appraisal Proceeding, and may make substantial investments in Appraisal Proceedings in 
jurisdictions (including non-U.S. jurisdictions) in which the applicable Law is not as well 
settled (or not as favorable to the Corporate Value Fund) as it is in Delaware. 
The duration of the Corporate Value Fund's different Corporate Event Investments is 
expected to be both variable and unpredictable. Hudson Bay Capital anticipates that
