event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to 
specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and 
as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and 
financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any 
change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the 
current categories of allocated expenses, which 
fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
category of expenses, would not be available for our 
expenses. The amount in the table above does not include interest available 
to us from the trust account. Based on the current 
interest rate environment, we would expect approximately $25,000 to be 
available to us from interest earned on the funds held 
in the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this offering; 
however, we can provide no assurances regarding 
this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based 
upon current yields of securities in which the 
trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance transaction 
costs in connection with an intended initial business 
combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our 
officers, directors and director nominees may, but are 
not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our 
initial business combination, we would repay such 
loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. 
Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of 
funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business 
combination does not close, we may use a portion of 
the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned 
amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would 
be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be 
convertible into warrants of the post business 
combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the 
lender. The warrants would be identical to the private 
placement warrants issued to the initial stockholder. The terms of such 
loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain 
of our officers, directors and director nominees, if any, have not been 
determined and no written agreements exist with respect 
to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our 
sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not 
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a 
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds 
in our trust account. 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
business combination to fund a "no shop" provision 
and commitment fees for financing. 
The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the 
gross proceeds from this offering 
and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net 
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the 
private placement warrants, approximately $135,000,000 (or approximately
