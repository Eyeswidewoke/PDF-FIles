"In order to realize an artificial light-har=esting system, almost 100% efficiency is necessary," Takagi told 
<=>PhysOrg.com. "Since light-harvesting systems consist of many =teps of bacteria 
<http://www.physorg.com/tags/energy+transfer/> or plant leaves) is composed of regularly =rranged molecules that 
efficiently collect sunlight and carry the excitati=n energy to the system's reaction center. An artificial LHS (or 
=E24040artificial leaf") attempts to do the same thing by using f=nctional dye molecules. 
Building on the results of previous research, the sc=entists chose to use two types of porphyrin dye molecules 
for this purpose= which they arranged on a clay surface. The molecules' tendency to=aggregate or segregate on the clay 
surface made it challenging for the res=archers to arrange the molecules in a regular pattern like their natural 
c=unterparts. 
"A molecular arrangement with an appropriate=intermolecular distance is important to achieve nearly 100% 
energy transfe= efficiency," Takagi said. "If the intermolecular distance=is too near, other reactions such as electron 
transfer and/or photochemica= reactions would occur. If the intermolecular distance is too far, deactiv=tion of excited 
dye surpasses the energy transfer reaction." </=> 
In order to achieve the appropriate intermolecular d=stance, the scientists developed a novel preparation 
technique based on ma=ching the distances between the charged sites in the porphyrin molecules a=d the distances 
between negatively charged (anionic) sites on the clay sur=ace. This effect, which the researchers call the "Size-Matching 
Ru=e," helped to suppress the major factors that contributed to the p=rphyrin molecules' tendency to aggregate or 
segregate, and fixed t=e molecules in an appropriate uniform intermolecular distance. As Takagi e=plained, this strategy 
is significantly different than other attempts at a=hieving molecular patterns. 
"The methodology is unique," he said= "In the case of usual self-assembly systems, the arrangement is r=alized 
by guest-guest interactions. In our system, host-guest interactions=play a crucial role for realizing the special 
arrangement of dyes. Thus, b= changing the host material, it is possible to control the molecular arran=ement of dyes on 
the clay surface." 
As the researchers demonstrated, the regular arrange=ent of the molecules leads to an excited energy transfer 
efficiency <http://www.phys=rg.com/tags/transfer+efficiency/> molecules <http://=ww.physorg.com/tags/molecules/> 
and clay h=st materials look like promising candidates for an artificial LHS.<=> 
"At the present, our system includes only tw= dyes," Takagi said. "As the next step, the combination of=several 
dyes to adsorb all sunlight is necessary. One of the characteristi= points of our system is that it is easy to use several 
dyes at once. Thus= our system is a promising candidate for a real light-harvesting system th=t can use all sunlight 
<http://www.physorg.com/tags/sunlight/> . We believe that even photochemical reaction parts can=be combined on 
the same clay surface. If this system is realized and is co=bined with a photochemical reaction center, this system can be 
called an =E24 inorganic leaf.'"
