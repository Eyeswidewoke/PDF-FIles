F
elix Worn, chief of the Asmat village of Syuru; looked 
intimidating in his grass skirt and fur headdress, 
bird feathers protruding from the side. A necklace 
of sharp animal teeth stretched across his bare, 
muscular chest, and his nose held a large curled ring. This 
ornament was made of seashell, but in the past it could have 
been carved from human bone. 
Twelve miles off the sparsely populated south coast of the 
Indonesian province of West Papua, Worn sat, unsmiling, for 
the fust time on the deck of a cruise ship. The 120-passenger 
Coral Adventurer was on an inaugural voyage to West Papua, 
which encompasses most of western New Guinea and other 
nearby islands, and the ship's captain had invited Worn and a 
handful of other village elders onboard to calm any fears about 
intruding foreigners. He offered them a look around, hats with 
baseball logos, and tins of butter cookies to take home. 
"They want to have a peek at us and really want to see 
the ship;' says tour lecturer Kathryn Robinson, a retired 
anthropology professor at Australian National University 
whose research focus includes Indonesia. "If you say no, 
because that would make us feel uncomfortable, that doesn't 
work.... Hospitality is a big thing in Indonesia." 
The chief already understood it—the symbiotic relationship 
between locals and visitors. "We can keep our culture because 
people come to see it," he said through a translator, acknowl-
edging the importance of the money the cruise line brings to 
his village. "We would be very 
happy to have more ships coin- . 
ingr As I walked away from our 
chat, the chief raised his chin, 
looked ahead at nothing, and 
let out a long rhythmic call. 
The Asmat people once 
were known as great warriors 
who used headhunting and 
cannibalism in their warfare, 
cultural rituals that ended for good about 60 year ago with 
the arrival of the Indonesian government. Photographer and 
art collector Michael Rockefeller, one of Nelson's five sons, may 
have been a victim of cannibalism after his boat overturned 
near an Asmat village in November 1964 according to the book 
Savage Harvest, by Carl Hoffman. His body was never found. 
The culture lives on in part through performance—which 
is how the government likes it, says Stuart Kirsch, a professor 
of anthropology at the University of Michigan who specializes 
in the Pacific region. "When you're not there, they're wearing 
Rolling Stones T-shirts from the global used-clothing market, 
cutoff jeans, and worn-out flip-flops," Kirsch says. West Papua 
has an independence movement, he says, but "that's typically 
scripted out of the tourist narrative:' 
Add the navigational difficulties of swirling winds, shallow 
seas, shifting sands, and multiple reefs, and it's no wonder trav-
elers seldom stop by. That our diesel-electric vessel was here, 
near the equator in the middle of hot nowhere, is a result of • 
the expanding market for expedition cruises. Such small-ship 
Asmat men from.the 
village of gyuru arrive 
. in canoesio oreat —and I 
Intimidate—visitors 
travel has drawn particular interest among baby boomers 
willing to pay fares that often top $1,000 a night for meaning-
ful soft adventure experiences in hard-to-reach destinations. 
In this growing niche of the cruise market, 39 expedition 
ships are set to make their debut from now to 2024, accord-
ing to Cruise Industry News. Big cruise companies are dipping 
their toes into the lucrative arena. Royal Caribbean Cruises 
Ltd. acquired four expedition ships (as well as five ultraluxury 
ships) last year when it paid about $1 billion fora two-thirds 
stake in Silversea Cruises Ltd. "It probably increased their fleet 
capacity by 2% but increased their profit flow by 6%. The profit 
per ship is that much higher," 
says Bloomberg Intelligence 
senior analyst Brian Egger. 
Most of the new boats are 
polar-class vessels bound for 
popular cold places such as 
Antarctica, Iceland, Greenland, 
and the Canadian High Arctic. 
But other cruises are sticking to 
the tropics. As a result, some of 
the most isolated people on Earth are seeing more visitors. 
Wom's village of Syuru, with its rustic houses and board-
walks crossing the swamp, will welcome four shiploads of 
cruisers this year, a number agreed upon by the government 
and tribal representatives. Timing is important in the expe-
dition business: The May itinerary of our round-trip cruise 
from Darwin, Australia, was tweaked so we could beat a ship 
owned by French line Ponant SA by a day. 
We arrived early in the morning after two sea days churn-
ing north from Darwin. Passengers boarded the ship's two 
hop-on, hop-off tenders and passed mangroves along a brack-
ish river on our way to the village. As we approached, dug-
out canoes from several clans emerged from shore. Athletic 
men and young boys paddled from a standing position, most 
in grass skirts, their faces and bodies covered with war paint, 
which assures the warriors their,ancestors will protect them. 
Men reached for the sides of our boats. Paddles thumped 
against wood in unison with war cries. "They are perform-
ing themselves as violent people;' Robinson said. "They are i 
"It's like anywhere 
where people are performing 
their culture. It can be 
uncomfortable, but it can also 
promote mutual recognition"
