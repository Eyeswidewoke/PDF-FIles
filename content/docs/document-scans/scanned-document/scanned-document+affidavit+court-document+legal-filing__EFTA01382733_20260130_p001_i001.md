General Provisions for Options and Shares under the Management Stockholder's Agreements 
If an NEO's employment with the Company terminates for any reason. all stock and vested options, to the extent not forfeited, are 
subject to call rights by Holdings until a Change in Control, as defined in the 2007 Equity Plan and Management Stockholder Agreement. 
If an NEO's employment terminates due to death or Disability (as defined in the Management Stockholder's Agreement) or the NEO's 
employment is terminated by the NEC) for Good Reason (as defined in the Management Stockholder's Agreement) or by the Company without 
Cause (as defined in the Management Stockholder's Agreement), call rights may be exercised by Holdings on vested options at the fair market 
value share price, less the exercise price. In this event, shares, including those issued upon exercise of an options, may be repurchased at the fair 
market value share price. In the event of death or Disability prior to a Change in Control, the NEC) has a put right on stock and vested options for 
fair market value in the case of stock and for the difference between the fair market value and the option exercise price in the case of vested 
options. 
If the NEO's employment is terminated voluntarily without Good Reason, all outstanding options whether vested or unvested 
automatically terminate (other than in the ease of Mr. Bisignano). In this event, shares issued upon exercise of an option may be called at the lesser 
of the original purchase price and fair market value per share price and all other shares may be called at fair market value per share unless the NEO 
is in violation of the restrictive covenants in the Management Stockholder's Agreement (or, in the case of Mr. Bisignano, the Employment 
Agreement) on the date that the call notice is sent, in which case the shares may be called at the lesser of the fair market value per share price or the 
original purchase price. These provisions greatly enhance the retention of executives who participate in the 2007 Equity Plan by eliminating all 
potential option gains for executives who voluntarily terminate prior to a Change in Control.
