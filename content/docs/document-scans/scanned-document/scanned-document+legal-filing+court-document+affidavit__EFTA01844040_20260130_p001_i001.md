Hi pumpkin...sorry things at work a little turbulent right now (not bad just unstable organizationally during reorg). 
Am talking to Boris this afternoon, as they have asked for my input on a hard problem that will have big 
implications for me. I want to talk to you about it too but Boris says you are traveling? I have been asked to 
submit a proposal/ideas/suggestions over the weekend so I will be working on that - if you have that would be 
great... 
Anyway yes in Ivory Coast - would be great to get feedback. I listened to you (and also to the people on the 
ground in various African countries). WHat they don't need is more external people telling them what to do or 
setting up entitlement programs that no one can support. So, here is the strategy I am using to help cities get 
better at raising their own money so they can do whatever they want with it. Right now Ethiopia, Ghana etc 
(priority countries for foundation) but if this resonates at all with you and you think Outtara would be interested, 
let me know? 
MISS YOU and thank you for thinking of me... 
Initiative 1: Mobilize sustainable domestic finance for more and better pro-poor 
investments in developing world cities. 
The Foundation's comparative advantage will be deployed in 3 complementary ways. 
1. Mainstreaming enabling environments: municipal finance markets require settled 
enabling environments for sustainable operations. Delivery responsibilities assigned 
to local governments, and the corresponding resource bases allocated to those local 
governments, must be clear and functional. Intergovernmental fiscal relations and 
flows must also be clear, predictable and fully owned by Ministries of Finance. Local 
government officials must be directly accountable to city residents, and local 
governments must have the capacity and systems to responsively plan, implement, 
operate and maintain pro-poor public investments. A growing number of African 
countries meet many of these critical enabling environment requirements. Program 
grants to the Cities Alliance (for Ghana, Rwanda and Uganda) and to GIZ (for Ethiopia) 
are providing a strong learning base. Our November 2011 Dakar Municipal Finance 
Convening identified additional country opportunities for this program approach, and 
3 or 4 new country programs are anticipated to begin in 2012 (estimated cost $10-$15 
million over X years). Based on several lenses including lessons from our learning 
initiative, foundation key geographies, and viable markets the GDUD team will assist 
high priority cities in establishing sound enabling environments. 
2. Making pro-poor cities creditworthy: Where effective enabling environments are 
established, assistance will be targeted to cities that demonstrate strong potential to 
become creditworthy and to define and implement pro-poor investments. Assistance 
will be tailored to the specific needs of participating cities and based on our budget 
and internal prioritization. For instance, some cities may require assistance in 
packaging and marketing investment programs with domestic financiers (e.g. 
Windhoek, Dakar, and Mbabane). Other cities may require support to institutionalize 
own-source revenues (e.g. regional capitals in Ethiopia). Other cities need assistance 
to restructure their finances at the national level (e.g. Zambia, Malawi, Kenya, and 
Tanzania). The GDUD team is finalizing (for February implementation) a program
