West Bank was the Armistice Line. negotiated between Israel and 
Jordan in 1949. Subsequently. Jordan annexed the West Bank but renounced its claim to this ferntory in 1988. 
Israel occupied this territory in the 1967 war. Since the 
Madrid peace conference in 1991. Israel and the Palestinians have been negotiating the details of the transfer of these temtones to the 
Palestinians. The expectation hes been that the Palestinians 
would set up an independent state. and Israeli security requirements would be addressed. 
Meantime. over the course of the last few generations. Israel has built settlements in the West Bank. (Israeli settlements in the 
Gaza Ship. taken from Egyptian control in 1967. were evacuated unilaterally by Israel in 2005)About 500.000 Israeli settlers 
live in settlements in the West Bank and in neighborhoods of 
Jerusalem considered by the international communityto be settlements. although Israel considers those neighborhoods to be pan of a sovereign 
united Jerusalem. About 80% of the Israeli settlers 
reside on about 5% of all settled land. 
What will happen to those settlements. some of which sit on land that Israel believes to be vital to its capacity to defend itself is one of 
the core issues in the peace negotiations. Israel insists upon retaining settlements in major blocs around Jerusalem and near the former 
Armistice lines. The Palestinians insist on regaining 100% of the West Bank or its equivalent 
Thus. we arrive at "swaps." 
Words matter in diplomacy. and the President did use a new formulation to describe American policy regarding the location of the border: The 
borders of Israel and Palestine."the President said. "should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreeable swaps, so that secure and 
recognized borders are established for both states." 
But Obama's words must be seen against the backdrop of formulations used by his two predecessors. 
Bill Clinton and 
George W Bush.
In parameters for negotiations laid out in early 2001. Clinton spoke about land swaps to badge Israeli desires to keep areas heavily settled 
since 1967 and Palestinian desires to get all the temtones occupied in the 1967 war. Clinton suggested percentages of land that would be 
involved in the swaps. 
Four years later. Bush sent a letter to then. Pnme 
Minister Ariel Sharon that approached the issue from a different angle. but with the same effect Bush said the U.S. understands it is not realistic 
to expect Israel to withdraw 'already existing major Israeli population centers' b a formulation 
widely believed to refer to the two or three largest Israeli settlement blocs bwto "'tun
 the
1949 Armistice lines; rather. Bush sad a peace agreement can be achieved only 'on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these 
realities.' 
On one level. a central question is whether there is any fundamental difference between Bush's. Clinton's and Obama's ways of framing the 
issue. 
B 
The answer is somewhat yes. but mostly no. Obama talked about a starting point for the negotiations on the border. while Bush talked about an 
end point. Both statements assume that the basis for negotiating the border is the line of 1967 or the armistice line of 1949 b effectively 
the same line. 
Further, Obama said a number of things in his speech specifically supportive of what 
Netanyahu has been demanding. He said 
Hamas is not a partner for peace as long as it does not recognize Israel or renounce 
terrorism. By implication, the President thus 
effectively opposed the recent reconciliation agreement between 
Fatah , which renounced terrorism in the 1993 
Oslo Accords, and Hamas, which has not renounced terrorism. Obama also criticized 
the Palestinians for considering a unilateral declaration 
of statehood. Most importantly, Obama associated the U.S. fully with the importance of 
recognizing Israel as a democratic and Jewish state; and he spoke at some length 
about the imperative of meeting Israel's security requirements in a manner that would
