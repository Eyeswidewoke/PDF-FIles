selling institutions may not vote in favor of any amendment, modification or waiver that forgives principal. interest 
or fees. reduces principal, interest or fees that are payable, postpones any payment of principal (whether a scheduled 
payment or a mandatory• prepayment), interest or fees or releases any material guarantee or security without the 
consent of the participant (at least to the extent the participant would be affected by any such amendment. 
modification or waiver). Selling institutions voting in connection with a potential waiver of a restrictive covenant 
may have interests different from those of the Issuer, and such selling institutions might not consider the interests of 
the Issuer in connection with their votes. In addition, many participation agreements that provide voting rights to 
the holder of the Participation further provide that if the holder does not vote in favor of amendments, modifications 
or waivers, the selling lender may repurchase such Participation at par. 
Debt obligations in the form of loans rather than bonds are generally subject to additional liquidity risks and, in 
some cases• credit risks. Loans are not generally traded in organized markets but are traded by banks and other 
institutional investors engaged in syndications and loan participations, respectively. Consequently, them can be no 
assurance that them will be any market for am' loan if the Issuer is required to sell or otherwise dispose of such loan. 
Depending on the terms of the underlying loan documentation, consent of the borrower may be required for an 
assignment, and a purported assignee may not have any direct right to enforce compliance by the obligor with the 
terms of the loan agreement in the absence of this consent. A holder of a Participation is subject to additional risks 
not applicable to a holder of a direct interest in a loan In the event of the insolvency of the selling institution under 
the laws of the United States and the various states thereof, a holder of a Participation may be treated as a general 
creditor of the selling institution and may not have any exclusive or senior claim with respect to the selling 
institution's interest in, or the collateral with respect to, the loan. Consequently, the holder of a Participation will be 
subject to the credit risk of the selling institution as well as of the borrower. Participants also often do not benefit 
from the collateral (if any) supporting the loans in which they have a participation interest because Participations 
often do not provide a purchaser with direct rights to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan 
agreement or any rights of set-off against the borrower. The Investment Manager is not required, and does not 
expect. to perform independent credit analyses of the selling institutions. 
The Collateral may include Second Lien Loans that are subordinated in right of payment to senior secured loans and 
other secured debt obligations of the related obligor. Accordingly. they are subject to a greater risk than senior 
secured loans that the available cash flows and the property. if any. securing such loans may be insufficient to make 
the scheduled payments and they may be subject to a higher degree of credit risk and more price volatility and may 
be less liquid than senior secured loans. Such loans may be subordinated to first lien debt obligations with respect to 
specific collateral of the obligor and in the event that the proceeds or value of such collateral is insufficient to repay 
the first lien debt obligations, the Second Lien Loans will likely suffer a loss of principal and interest. Such Second 
Lien Loans will generally have rights that arc subordinated to those of the first lien debt obligations. Second Licn 
Loans are subject to the same risks as senior secured loans, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and 
interest rate risk. However, due to the subordinated nature of these loans they involve a higher degree of overall risk 
than the senior secured loans of the same obligor. 
Investing in Non-U.S. Assets. A portion of the Collateral is expected to be securities and obligations of issuers that 
are not domiciled in the United States. Such non-U.S. securities and obligations are subject to regional economic 
conditions and sovereignty risks not normally associated with investments in United States issuers. including risks 
associated with political and economic uncertainty, fluctuations of currency exchange rates, differing levels of 
disclosure and regulation of non-U.S. nations or other taxes imposed with respect to investments in non-U.S. 
nations, foreign currency exchange controls (which may include suspension of the ability either to transfer currency 
front a given country or to repatriate investments) and uncertainties as to the status. interpretation and application of 
laws. In addition, information about non-U.S. issuers is often less publicly available than information about U.S. 
issuers. 
Moreover, non-U.S. issuers may not be subject to uniform accounting. auditing and financial reporting standards, 
and auditing practices and requirements may not be comparable to those applicable to U.S. companies. It may also 
be more difficult to obtain and enforce a judgment relating to obligations of non-U.S. persons in a court outside of 
the United Slams. 
Acquisition and Sale of Collateral. By the Closing Date, the Issuer will have purchased or entered into agreements 
to purchase Collateral Obligations with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $260 million. The 
Investment Manager expects to purchase (and enter into agreements to purchase) additional Collateral Obligations
