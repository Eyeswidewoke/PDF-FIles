happened," and had told untruths not only to the prosecutors but under oath to the grand jury 
about her whereabouts after the encounter. It was a startling turn of events for prosecutors to 
discredit their own star witness. 
The judge had little choice but to approve the motion. DSK 
then left the court, an innocent man in the eyes of the law. 
PART FOUR 
PIECES Of A PUZZLE 
Chapter VI 
Surveillance 
The French Direction Centrale du Renseignement interieur, or, as it is called, the DCRI, is 
highly regarded by CIA officers who liaised with it. A former CIA executive stationed in Paris, in 
describing its technological competence in remote surveillance, told me how it had once bugged 
the first class seats on Air France to eavesdrop on conversations of a few targeted individuals. 
This provided "unexpected intelligence" since the targets would assume that their conversation 
could not be intercepted 30,000 feet above the Atlantic. The DCRI is equally innovative when it 
comes to smart phones, It now has a special unit, called rl, dedicated entirely to surreptitiously 
using targeted individuals' cell phones to spy on them. If necessary, it can also employ 
traditional methods, such as "black bag jobs," to fill gaps in its remote surveillance. One such 
technique involves in planting devices on target's phones that both bypass the security encryption 
and act as spare batteries to supply power if user attempts to temporarily disable his phone by 
removing the battery. " "One should never underestimate how good the French have become at 
this game," the ex-CIA official added. 
There is little doubt that the French Ministry of the Interior, under whose authority the DCRI 
operates, had kept data on DSK. According to a December 2011 article in Le Monde entitled 
"What Sarkozy Knew About DSK," the DSK dossier may have extended back to 2006, when 
Sarkozy was the Minister of the Interior. It cites an incident in which DSK was stopped by the 
Paris police on the periphery of the Bois de Boulogne because it was an area notorious for 
prostitutes. It was also only about 200 meters from DSK's home, and he was then allowed to 
proceed without incident. Even though no crime had been alleged and no report was ever 
officially filed with the police, years later Claude Gueant, the new Minister of the Interior, 
revealed in an interview such precise details about this Bois de Boulogne incident that it could 
only have come from a secret report. Gueant denied such a dossier existed in the Ministry. But 
wherever that information came from, in 2011, after DSK emerged as a possible Socialist 
candidate preparing to run for the Presidency of France, he was presumably of great interest to 
the Sarkozy Administration. He had also become in 2011 a "target" of the DCRI, according to 
the recent book "The President's Spy." The authors, Didier Hassoux, Christophe Labbe, and 
Olivia Recasens, are all investigative journalists with the French weekly Le Point, who based 
their findings heavily on interviews they had with present and former members of the DCRI. 
They describe in some detail how the director of the DCRI, Bernard Squarcini, had set up "a 
special group" in collaboration with the Elysees Palace to focus on DSK in March 2011— two 
months before DSK was arrested in New York. If so, Sarkozy's staff was likely privy to the 
intelligence that was being collected by the DCRI. For his part, Squarcini has publically denied 
that the DCRI spied on ASK. 
This special group had began operating, according to this book, at about the time that the
