[HN11] A "make-whole" premium is a contractual substitute for interest lost on notes that 
are redeemed before their expected due date. Its purpose is to ensure that a lender is 
compensated for being paid earlier than the original maturity of its loan for the interest it 
will not receive.

[HN12] The principle of "equitable mootness" is a prudential doctrine that is invoked to 
avoid disturbing a reorganization plan once it is implemented. The doctrine allows 
appellate courts to dismiss bankruptcy appeals when, during the pendency of an appeal, 
events occur such that even though effective relief could conceivably be fashioned, 
implementation of that relief would be inequitable. The doctrine requires an appellate court 
to carefully balance the importance of finality in bankruptcy proceedings against ane 
appellant's right to review and relief.

[HN13] Where a reorganization plan has been substantially consummated, the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit presumes that an appeal of that plan is 
equitably moot. That presumption, however, gives way where five factors the Second 
Circuit first identified in In re Chateaugay Corp. ("Chateaugay II") are met. They are, 
where: (i) effective relief can be ordered; (ii) relief will not affect the debtor's reemergence; 
(iii) relief will not unravel intricate transactions; (iv) affected third-parties are notified and 
able to participate in the appeal; and (v) an appellant diligently sought a stay of the 
reorganization plan. Although the Second Circuit requires satisfaction of each Chateaugay 
II factor to overcome a mootness presumption, it has placed significant reliance on the fifth 
factor, concluding that a chief consideration under Chateaugay II is whether an appellant 
sought a stay of confirmation. Along those lines, the Second Circuit concluded in In re 
Metromedia, that if a stay was sought, it will provide relief if it is at all feasible, that is, 
unless relief would knock the props out from under the authorization for every transaction 
that has taken place and create an unmanageable, uncontrollable situation for the 
bankruptcy court.

[HN14] Equitable mootness issues only arise in earnest following a judicial determination 
that some facet of a reorganization plan violates the Bankruptcy Code. It is generally 
considered inappropriately harsh to deny relief to which one is entitled on the purportedly
