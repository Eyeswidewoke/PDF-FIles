Hi =effrey, 
I just got back to Hong Kong. Just pinged =iuseppe regarding getting you summary notes. I had a program that =ad a list 
of the talks, but didn't get the abstracts to the =alks. The team (Giuseppe, Ornella, and Peter Valdes Soza) are =rateful 
for your sponsorship, without which, the event would not have =een possible. I also offered to organise a gathering just 
for you =n NYC after you were not able to attend (and they could not move the =vent). 
For =e, it was an eye-opening event to understand in two ways: =nbsp; 
1) The time spent with Peter Fenwick =nd Fabio Babiloni on experiment design and the discussions I had with =abiloni 
on sub-cortical and cortical processing in relation to symbolic =onsciousness and the development of the psyche. 
2) To understand the development of mental health in =uba. There is strong interest in meditation and Eastern 
practices =here. In fact, they are organizing another conference in April =pecifically on meditation that I may attend. 
They also have =eople that have developed special abilities (based upon my =onversations with Nibaldo Hernandez 
Mesa). 
After our meeting in =YC, I gave two more talks for "fringe groups" involved =n a practice I don't condone, "psychedelic 
awakening.=9D (https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/unique-everybody-else/2012=2/the-spirituality-psychedelic-
drug-users) and was able to =E24040work" on two of the subjects with very good results. =nbsp;They were "stage 3" 
from the model that I =resented to you via Skype 
(https://photos.google.com/share/AF1ClipOBQa4z8TRJ7B0XwvassIgeBXp=7rmnXAs3FZQyuVQx8w2Hpze3yG_Iqp2wNSfF 
LA?key=RGR3MGNYaW1LSTZMX2RaSzJIR2Rj=l2QaUxQTESR) and the framework, combined with some practices that I 
=ave them, were able to contextualise their experience and continue =heir personal development along a more mystical 
path. The methods =nd models that I've been developing were also applied to Joe =r.who is now doing well 
(psychologically) and also becoming effective =n entraining presence in others. He also accompanied me during =he rest 
of my time in NYC and worked on many others (including Jim who =ou enquired about in one of the photos). I sent you 
some photos =ocumenting some of our meetings. 
After my talk at the Assemblage (https://www.dropbox.com/s/x9bwutdvyr037q2/NYC.pdf?dl=0), =any people including 
Jim (mentioned above) came to talk to me regarding =heir personal development and our time together following my 
talk has =rought them greater clarity on their personal development. An =xample of another person who reached out to 
me is listed below. =nbsp;ln San Francisco, I stayed with Masha and Varvara and helped to =ort them out a bit. Lydia 
also came over and I spent some time =ith her helping her re-contextualize her awakening experience. =nbsp; 
I was =oping to talk to you more about all of this in our meeting together. =nbsp;l see them as very positive signs, not 
only on the research side =f developing experiments, but with very practical applications that are =enefiting the lives of 
others (people that are in stage 3 to stage 4). =nbsp;The Polystery proposal and plans to put together a global network 
=o develop research in this area and provide support for seekers and =eople in advanced stages of personal 
development. 
I am grateful for the =upport thus far. When you offered me the 100K last year, my only =equest has been to support 
the Cuba Conference when they asked for 25K. =nbsp;My travel to see you, introductions to others, and the Vive that I 
=ought for you, but have not yet installed, have come out of pocket. =nbsp;I feel like this year of exploring and your 
generous support, =ombined with others such as Wendy Ma who has funded me to run (www.cgcsts.org) for the =ext 9
