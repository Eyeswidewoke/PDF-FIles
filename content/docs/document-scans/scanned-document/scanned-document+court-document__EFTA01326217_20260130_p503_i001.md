Remind the fact to flight status and recorded compliance with cis FAA Form 337 in the aircraft's nuirdeconce records. 
It has beat determined that the interrelationship between this change and any previously approved configuration will 
not introduce any ads:Serf= upon the airworthiness of the aircraft This determination includes. but is not limited 
to: The change to the aircraft's electrical load analysis data is negligible; When performing its intended functions the 
operation is automatic: There are no changes to the operational limitations; No flight manual supplants are 
squired; and the installation is compatible with all prmious alterations assuring continuous conformity with the 
applicable airworthiness requirements. 
The effect of this change on the aintralts weight and balance dm is negligible.
