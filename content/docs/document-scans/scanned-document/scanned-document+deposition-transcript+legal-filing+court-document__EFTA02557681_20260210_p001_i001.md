What Did Castro Know-- And When Did He Know It By Edward Jay Epstein In 1976 Thomas Mann, who had been the U.S. 
ambassador to Mexico in =963, told me that he believed that there was "an indictable case" =hat Castro had been 
involved in the Kennedy assassination, but when he =ontinued reporting this view in cables to the State Department, he 
was =ired. Now there is a new book by Brian Latell, the CIA's former =ational intelligence officer for Latin America, that 
again raises the =uestion: What did Castro know — and when did he know it — about =he Kennedy assassination? 
Prior to this book, here is what has been established. On November 22, =963, there were actually two jackals on the 
prowl: one in Dallas, =exas, the other in Paris, France. 
In Dallas that day, Lee Harvey Oswald, who previously had attempted to =ssassinate General Edwin Walker, was working 
under a false name at the =exas Book Depository, which overlooked the route that President John =. Kennedy would 
take that day. Oswald had arrived at work that morning =ith a package that, as the FBI lab would later establish, 
contained =is rifle. 
Less than two months earlier, Oswald, under his real identity, had gone =o the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and met 
with Cuban officials. Even =hough the Cuban government did not then grant visas to individual =merican citizens who 
were not sponsored by government organizations, =n October 15 his application was processed in Havana. On October 
18, =he Cuban foreign ministry notified the embassy in Mexico that it could =ssue Oswald a visa if he also obtained a 
Russian entry visa, so an =xception was made in his case. 
The jackal in Paris was Major Rolando Rubella who, as a close associate =f Fidel Castro, was allowed to travel abroad for 
the Cuban government. =hat Castro supposedly did not know was that Cubela had been recruited =y the CIA and given 
the code name AMLASH. His CIA mission would be to =ssassinate Castro. During the Collegiate Games in Porto Alegre, 
=razil, that took place from September 5-8, 1963, he met with CIA case =fficer Nestor Sanchez and tentatively agreed to 
this mission. Although =e had asked to meet with Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the best the =IA could do was 
arrange a meeting in a safe house in Paris on October =9, 1963, with Desmond Fitzgerald, a high-ranking CIA officer, who 
=dentified himself as the personal representative of Robert Kennedy. 
At this point, the jackal asked Fitzgerald to supply him with a =igh-powered rifle with telescopic sights that could be used 
to kill =astro from a distance and to insert an agreed-upon phrase in a speech =resident Kennedy would give in Miami. 
The phrase was inserted, thus =onfirming that the CIA had the backing of the President. 
The next meeting took place in Paris on November 22 at the time that =FK's motorcade was moving past the Texas Book 
Depository. Instead of =he requested rifle, the CIA offered Cubela a poison pen with a =oncealed syringe. In the midst of 
the meeting, the news arrived that =ennedy had been shot. Cubela returned to Cuba but never carried out =he 
assassination assignment. 
The burning issue for the CIA was whether Castro learned about this =lot. It knew that Castro had intentionally revealed 
he knew about CIA =upport for an operation to eliminate him on September 7, 1963. It also =new that was the very day 
that the CIA was meeting with its jackal in =razil. 
Even more ominously, Castro chose a diplomatic reception at the =razilian Embassy, which was Brazilian territory. At the 
reception, he =ent directly over to the US correspondent for the Associate Press, =aniel Harker, and told him, in an on-
the-record interview, that =93United States leaders should think that if they are aiding terrorist =tans to eliminate Cuban 
leaders, they themselves will not be safe." 
The timing and Brazilian connection were enough to convince James Jesus =ngleton, the CIA's legendary 
counterintelligence chief, that the =ubela operation was "insecure." He warned Cubela's handlers that =he fact that 
Cubela had refused the CIA request to take a lie detector =xamination made him suspect and recommended, without 
success, that the =peration be ended.
