Symptom 1 
Handset Display is 
illuminated and 
display indicates no 
signal for Satellite 
(SAT) mode. 
Possible Cause 3A 
System antenna does not have 
Line of Sight (LOS) view to 
satellite. 
The ST 3100 transceiver operates in 
Satellite (SAT) mode. When in 
coverage the ST system should 
detect and register for SAT mode 
service. 
If the system does not register, then 
it is likely that either the antenna 
does not have a LOS to a satellite 
(3A), or there is a problem with the 
RF channel in the aircraft (38). In 
this condition, it is unlikely that 
there is a problem with the system 
transceiver, 
Verification Test 3A 
O 
Verify that the system SAT antenna has a clear LOS to the sky in all directions. A 
clear LOS is defined to exist when there are no obstructions (such as buildings, 
trees, vehicles etc) that are higher than 30 degrees above aircraft horizon in any 
direction. This should never be a problem in flight. 
O 
Use the handset to enter the SAT lock mode (FCN, 3, 3) keys on the handset. The 
handset will display the word "IRIDIUM" when the SAT mode is locked. 
O 
Once the LOS has been established the system should register on the SAT network 
within 60 seconds. The system is registered when the "NO SVC" indicator is not 
visible on the handset display.
O If the "NO SVC" indicator extinguishes, then the SAT mode is engaged, and the 
problem is resolved. The user may choose to make a test call and verify the 
operation the system. 
O If the-NO SVC" indicator stays illuminated, then the system cannot register, and it 
is likely that there is an installation or equipment problem. Either contact AirCell 
Technical Support for additional guidance, or proceed to Verification Test 38. 
No Satellite mode 
signal 
Possible Cause 3D 
There is a problem with the 
Satellite RF channel. 
Verification Test 3D 
O 
While the aircraft is on the ground, perform a visual inspection orate ASE system 
satellite antenna. Verify that the antenna is installed to the aircraft fuselage in 
accordance with the system antenna installation drawings. Verify the mechanical 
integrity of the antenna, and that the antenna is reasonably free of dirt, oil, ice and 
other undesired coatings. 
O 
Visually inspect the RF satellite channel, including the coaxial connections to the 
antenna and the system transceiver. Inspect the coaxial connectors to verify that 
they are connected in accordance with the system wiring diagram, and that they arc 
not damaged. Look for breaks, kinks or other damage to the coaxial cable. 
0 
The user is authorized to correct installation errors (such as cabling errors), or to 
repair minor damage (such as broken coaxial connections, damaged coaxial cables, 
etc). The user is not authorized to open or modify sealed LRUs. 
O If these steps do not resolve the problem, contact AirCell Technical Support for 
additional guidance. 
Other conditions 
For all other conditions, contact AirCell Technical Support for guidance.
