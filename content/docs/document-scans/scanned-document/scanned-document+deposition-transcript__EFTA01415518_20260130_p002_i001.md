Notes. 
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an 
adverse effect on the Issuer, particularly if such financial institution is 
the administrative agent of a leveraged loan or is a selling institution 
with respect to a participation. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency or 
financial distress of one or more additional financial institutions, or one 
or more sovereigns, may trigger additional crises in the global credit 
markets and overall economy which could have a significant adverse effect on 
the Issuer, the Assets and the Notes. 
Limited Liquidity and Restrictions on Transfer. Barclays is under no 
obligation to create or maintain a secondary market in the Notes. There is 
currently no market for the Notes and it is unlikely that a secondary market 
for the Notes will develop. Additionally, the Notes will not be registered 
under any federal or state securities laws, and such Notes are being issued 
and sold in reliance upon exemptions from registration provided by such 
laws. The Notes will be subject to certain transfer restrictions and will 
only be transferable to certain permitted transferees to be identified in 
the Transaction documentation. Furthermore, the Issuer will restrict 
ownership of any interests in the Subordinated Notes so that no assets of 
the Issuer will be deemed to be "plan assets" subject to ERISA and/or 
Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code. An investor may not be able to 
find a buyer for the Notes or any other product should it wish to sell such 
product. If a buyer can be found, the price offered by that buyer may be 
lower than the price that an investor paid for the product or the amount an 
investor would otherwise receive on the maturity of the product. 
In 
addition, small holdings may not be transferable, and where a Note has a 
minimum specified denomination or settlement amount, an investor will not be 
able to transfer the Note unless it increases its holding to at least that 
minimum denomination or settlement amount. An investor in the Notes must be 
prepared to hold for an indefinite period of time or until maturity or 
redemption. 
Regulatory Changes. In response to the downturn in the credit markets and 
the global economic crisis, various agencies and regulatory bodies of the 
U.S. federal government have taken or are considering taking actions to 
address the financial crisis. These actions include, but are not limited 
to, the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act ("Dodd Frank Act"), which was signed into law on July 21, 
2010, and which imposes a new regulatory framework over the U.S. financial 
services industry and the consumer credit markets in general, and proposed 
regulations by the SEC that, if enacted, would significantly alter the 
manner in which asset-backed securities, including securities similar to the 
Notes, are issued and structured and increase the reporting obligations of 
the issuers of such securities. On August 28, 2013, joint regulators in the 
United States re-proposed credit risk retention rules under Section 941 of 
Dodd-Frank. These re-proposed rules have not yet gone into effect and are 
subject to comment and further modification by the joint regulators. 
Given 
the broad scope and sweeping nature of the changes and the fact that final 
implementing rules and regulations have not yet been enacted, the potential 
impact of these actions on the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, any of the 
Notes, any owners of interests in the Notes or the CLO market generally is
