wide efforts aimed at countering terrorist attacks involving unconventional weapons, known as WMD." More 
than 30 current and former Homeland Security employees and contractors "voiced concern that the changes —
including the cancellation of dozens of training exercises and the departure of scores of scientists and policy 
experts — have put Americans at greater risk." 
The Hill (7/18, Mitchell, 2.98M) reports on the LA Times story, and notes that the LATimes "found that 
more than 100 scientists and policy experts with knowledge of radiological and nuclear threats were 
reassigned or given positions not related to their expertise." The LA Times noted that the "same has happened 
to numerous more scientists and experts specializing in countering biological threats." 
Senate Reaches Deal To Vote Next Week On Bill Extending Compensation Fund For 9/11 First Responders. 
The Washington Post (7/18, Sonmez, Barrett, 14.2M) reports the Senate on Thursday "reached an agreement to 
hold a vote next week on legislation extending a victims compensation fund for 9/11 workers, following an 
emotional appeal by comedian Jon Stewart and first responders." Senate Majority Leader McConnell's office 
"said that the vote will take place on or before next Wednesday and that the Senate will also consider two 
amendments" — one offered by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), the other by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY). 
The AP (7/18, Daly) reports Senate Minority Leader Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) "said 
Thursday they had reached an agreement" with Lee and Paul "to bring up the bill no later than Wednesday." 
The agreement came after "comedian Jon Stewart again blasted Republicans who have held up the bill." 
The Hill (7/18, Wise, 2.98M) reports Paul accused Stewart of being "a member of the left-wing mob' 
Thursday after the comedian and activist called Paul's move to block legislation to extend the September 11th 
Victim Compensation Fund an `abomination."' While speaking with host Neil Cavuto on Fox News, "Paul 
argued that he's spent his entire Senate career putting forward  'pay-fors anytime spending is expanded,' 
including for disaster relief funding." NBC Nightly NewS:Avn (7/18, story 9, 1:45, Holt, 127K) reported that 
Paul said, "So if Jon Stewart could read, maybe he could read the bill and say, 'Oh my God, who in their right 
mind would vote for a bill that doesn't have a dollar amount in it.'" 
The Hill (7/18, Camey, 2.98M) reports that the bill, which passed the House in a 402-12 vote, "would 
reauthorize funding until fiscal 2090" and is "expected to easily pass the Senate." 
CBS Remembers New York Firefighters Who Died Of Cancer. The CBS Evening Newskies:,. (7/18, story 
12, 0:50, O'Donnell, 251K) remembered "two brave New York firefighters who worked on the 9/11 rescue and 
recovery. Kevin Nolan was 58, and Richard Driscoll was 73. Both died of cancer." It added, "Paul blocked a 
fast-tracking of the bill, noting the country is $22 trillion in debt. But what about the debt of gratitude America 
owes first responders and their families? That is a debt the country can never repay for sacrifices we can't 
afford to forget." 
German Police Detain Six Suspected Islamic Extremists.

and tried repeatedly to travel to territory controlled by the Islamic State group, senior police official Klaus-

COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
Career Officials Say White House Didn't Pressure Them On Security Clearances. 
The Hill (7/18, Enjeti, 2.98M) reports in an exclusive that during a closed door session of the House Oversight 
Committee, "two career White House security officials" testified "that no political pressure was asserted on 
their office in determining security clearances, according to a GOP staff memo obtained by Hill. TV" 
According to the memo, career White House security official Crede Bailey testified "that he at no point felt 
pressure from anyone at the White House to determine a security clearance one way or the other." Similarly, 
former career employee Cory Louie "testified that at no time in his two week tenure in the security office 
under the Trump administration did he ever feel undue political influence on the security clearance process." 
The Hill says their testimony "could deal a blow to Democratic assertions that President Trump and the White 
House counsel might have used undue influence on the process to win clearances for his son-in-law Jared 
Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump."
