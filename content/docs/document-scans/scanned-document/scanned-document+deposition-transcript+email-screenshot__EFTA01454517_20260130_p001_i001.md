Macro Strategy (J. Reid, N. Burns, A. Ip) 
I'll be honest and say that yesterday's EMR was a bit of a daze. I had a 
belated party for my 40th on Saturday and spent virtually the entire Friday 
night awake with my builders trying to put a house back together that has 
been owned by the builders for 8 months. I had 15 people there until 4am 
Friday night with 3 of them working non-stop until the first guests arrived 
at 230pm. Never have I been so stressed and tired. So all day Sunday and 
Monday morning were a bit of a daze. sadly I'm now back living with builders 
again as they finish things off after the party. It was blissful for the few 
hours we were apart. At least we've moved out of the kitchen where we were 
living and sleeping for nearly 5 months before last week. Hopefully by the 
time the second half of the year ends I'll never have to see a builder again. 
Anyway, the second half has now begun for markets and in our H1/02/ June 
performance review today we show that most assets have had a positive year so 
far. So much so that if the year eventually goes to penalties it will end up 
being a very poor second half showing in line with many of England's in 
recent years!! we briefly review the numbers at the end but all the data and 
charts are in the pdf of this document. Its pretty rare to have almost all 
main global assets in positive territory this far into a year. Central bank 
liquidity continues to drive markets in our opinion which has helped this 
synchronised uplift in valuations. However we can't help sensing that there's 
less joy over these returns than might be expected. Investors are worried 
about valuations in numerous assets and worried that the Fed might become 
more hawkish soon. There's little chance of the ECB following suit anytime 
soon though and European Government bonds have had a very good 2014 so far. 
Over the last month we've again highlighted how many European Government bond 
markets have hit multi-century, all time yield lows. Well yesterday it was 
the turn of the Dutch 10 year yield to go through it's all time low again. 
The Dutch series is where we have our longest history of any government bond 
market with data going back to 1517 spanning almost half a millennia. The 
graph is in the pdf today and further shows just how unique the current
