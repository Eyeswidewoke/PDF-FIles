785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
complains of mistreatment in a discrimination case, a district court does not clearly err in 
finding that such complaints do not establish a "standard operating procedure" of 
discrimination, Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 336, "significant adverse effects" on the relevant 
class, Watson, 487 U.S. at 986, or "significant proof' of class-wide discrimination, Wal-
Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2553.

What may matter more than the quantity of a plaintiffs evidence is its quality. If, for 
instance, the anecdotal evidence is indirect and circumstantial, the district court might 
justifiably probe whether that evidence truly gives rise to a necessary inference of 
discrimination. After all, "a district court may properly consider the quality of any anecdotal 
evidence." Rossini v. Ogilvy & Mather, Inc., 798 F.2d 590, 604 (2d Cir. 1986); accord 
Eastland v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 704 F.2d 613, 625 (11th Cir. 1983). 
At least as to the promotions-related matters at issue in this appeal, Plaintiffs (-1371 do 
not present compelling anecdotal evidence. Byron Turner, for instance, does not address 
promotions at all. Neither does Walter Joseph Cook. In what might be an employment law 
first, Kenneth Hubbard complains that Nucor promoted him. See J.A. 1097; cf. Kalamazoo 
Cnty. Rd. Comm'n v. Deleon, 135 S. Ct. 783, 784, 190 L. Ed. 2d 887 (2015) (Alito, J., 
dissenting from denial of certiorari) ("Respondent's supervisors did not violate federal law 
by granting him the transfer that he sought and that they had no reason to believe he did 
not want."). And Earl Ravenell testifies about a time that he applied for a promotion and 
was not selected — because another black employee was selected for that opening. He 
also tells us that he chose not to apply for any other positions because of "the look on his 
[supervisor]'s face." J.A. 1111. These and other examples are not "cherry pick[ed]," maj. 
op. at 41, but merely offer some insight into why the district court could reasonably decide 
differently than the majority does. 
Much of the anecdotal evidence also amounts to conclusory and speculative statements of 
personal belief. For instance, even those employees who do mention job qualifications rely 
almost exclusively on their personal, subjective, and unsubstantiated views of their own 
abilities. ["*138] We usually do not give such testimony much, if any, weight. See Williams 
v. Giant Food Inc., 370 F.3d 423, 433 (4th Cir. 2004); Evans v. Techs. Applications & Serv. 
Co., 80 F.3d 954, 960 (4th Cir. 1996). Other employees assume racism in the process 
without identifying an objective fact to support that view. Named plaintiff Ramon Roane 
declares, for example, that he applied for a position that was "suddenly cancelled because 
Nucor was not ready for an African American to hold a supervisory position." J.A. 996. Yet 
he does not explain how or why he came to that conclusion, [*9513] and "[a] plaintiffs self-
serving opinions, absent anything more, are insufficient to establish a prima facie case of 
discrimination." Mackey v. Shalela, 360 F.3d 463, 469-70 (4th Cir. 2004). 
In addition, Plaintiffs' evidence is often so incomplete that it lacks any probative value. For 
example, Bernard Beaufort discusses a promotions decision that he believes "was made 
unfairly." J.A. 6008. But he does not know who eventually received the job, what his or her 
race was, "what [the decision] was based on," or whether "it was based on [his] race." J.A. 
6008. Other employees testify about not receiving promotions, but many of these 
declarants do not indicate whether they were minimally qualified for the position or whether
