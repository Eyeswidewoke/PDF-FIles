° The lead author is Steven L. Small. M.D., 
Ph.D., a Professor of Neurology and Psychology, 
Associate Chair for Research in Neurology, 
Member of the Committees on Neurobiology and 
Computational Neuroscience, and Senior Fellow, 
Computation Institute, at The University of 
Chicago. Ile is currently Director of the Human 
Neuroscience Laboratory and was founder of the 
Brain Research Imaging Center. He is an elected 
member of the American Neurological 
Association, a fellow of the American Academy 
of Neurology, and Editor-in-Chief of the 
international journal Brain and Language. 
Small's research concerns the neural basis of 
human language and its breakdown after injury. 
lie has published more than 120 scientific 
articles, primarily about human language, from 
the perspectives of artificial intelligence, 
cognitive psychology, computational 
neuroscience. human systems neuroscience, and 
clinical neurology. 
I luman language represents a unique 
product of our social species and the tremendous 
evolution of the primate cerebral cortex 
simultaneously supported the development of 
both. Language is the defining feature of our 
species: In his 126' century volume, Guide to the 
Perplexed, Maimonides viewed it as tautological 
that man is a speaking animal, i.e., "there is no 
third element besides life and speech in the 
definition of man". But how does the brain 
implement this unique function in the context of 
its common ontogeny with social function? The 
current essay discusses the possibility that the 
recently discovered "mirror neurons" of the 
cerebral cortex of macaque monkeys play a 
special role in the ability of humans to 
understand each other with language by using a 
mechanism of observation and covert emulation. 
If the neurobiology of language were partly 
grounded on such systems of visual observation 
and imitation, this would overlap integrally with 
the biology of the social brain. 
It is one thing to perceive objects 
in the environment and another to 
understand what is perceived. A rodent 
that senses an apple definitely has a 
notion that this represents something 
edible. A monkey might realize that the 
apple can be eaten but also can be 
thrown. A human might perceive it as a 
food, an object to be propelled, a 
temptation that should be resisted, or 
something that falls out of a tree at a 
specific acceleration. For each individual 
animal or person, understanding an apple 
means to take the sensory perceptions of 
the apple and to use previous experience 
and knowledge to fit it into an overall 
context. In this way, understanding a 
particular apple depends on our 
previously having seen, touched, and 
smelled apples, eaten them, read about 
them, and perhaps even been hit by a 
falling or thrown apple. All of our 
previous experiences come to bear every 
time we encounter a new perception that 
we must make sense of, and of course, 
this represents virtually every moment of 
our waking lives. 
Our perceptions vary enormously 
from seeing simple objects (e.g., apples), 
taking in more complex entities (e.g., 
restaurants, neighborhoods), hearing 
noises or speech, and seeing actions 
(e.g., simple manual actions, sporting 
events). A major question for brain 
research is how we can possibly 
understand all these different kinds of 
input, and what brain circuits are used to 
do so. We assume that such an 
understanding means taking these inputs, 
weighing them against our previous
