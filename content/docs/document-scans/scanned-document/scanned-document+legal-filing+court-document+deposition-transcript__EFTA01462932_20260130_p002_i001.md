information for, your collateral contact. Please provide the necessary 
contact information as soon as possible 
Second, your collateral contact will receive an IM segregation right 
notice. This notice will contain a non-exclusive list of acceptable 
custodians, together with relevant pricing information, if any. 
Counterparties subject to the May 5 compliance date will receive the IM 
segregation right notice from DB prior to the compliance deadline. 
Third, the IM segregation right notice will have a schedule whereby you must 
confirm receipt of the notice and elect whether or not you require IM 
segregation. Counterparties subject to the May 5 compliance date will need 
to make their election and deliver it to DB at the address provided. Please 
deliver this notice well in advance of the relevant compliance date. 
As the regulation prohibits DB from taking IM until your election has been 
received and, if relevant, executing an acceptable triparty custodian 
agreement, any delay in responding may inhibit our ability to transact 
uncleared swaps with you after the relevant compliance date. Please discuss 
with your DB sales representative 
8. What are the implications of electing to require IM segregation? 
If you elect to require IM segregation, it will be necessary to execute a 
tri-party custodial agreement prior to entering into any further uncleared 
swaps with DB after the compliance date. Such custodial agreement must be 
compliant with the regulation 
You will be responsible for establishing the required communication and data 
information exchange capabilities with your selected custodian 
As negotiating an acceptable tri-party arrangement may be time consuming, 
counterparties who wish to avoid trading disruptions should carefully 
consider their election. Please speak with your Sales representative to 
discuss timing prior to finalizing your election 
Where applicable, your existing Credit Support Annex will need to be amended 
9. What are the implications of electing to not require IM segregation? 
Your existing contractual arrangements with respect to IM will be 
preserved. In addition, any pending or future negotiations with respect to 
IM segregation will not be impacted by such election 
If you elect to not require IM segregation, the regulation requires DB to 
report to you, on a quarterly basis, whether or not our back office 
procedures relating to margin and collateral requirements were, at any point 
during the previous quarter, not in compliance with the agreement of the 
parties 
10. What if I already have a custodial arrangement in place? 
An election to segregate will require your existing custodial arrangements 
be amended to be compliant with the regulation. Therefore, choosing to 
elect segregation may inhibit DB's ability to transact uncleared swaps with 
you after the relevant compliance date 
An election to not require segregation will preserve your existing 
contractual arrangements, including with respect to any IM segregation 
already in place. Any pending or future negotiations with respect to IM 
segregation will not be impacted by such election 
11. What are the implications of not responding? 
The regulation requires DB to obtain your election whether or not you 
require IM segregation. A failure to respond may therefore inhibit DB's 
ability to transact any uncleared swaps with you after the relevant
