Aircraft Type Certificate Data Sheet Al2EA. 
FAA APPROVED DATA: 
GAC Recommended Air.:raft Service Change (AEC) 134, Subject: 
FUEL 
(ATA 28) FUEL BOOST PUMP CONTROL-MODIFICATION, dated April 28. 1991; and CAC ASC 134 
mendaent 1, dated June 1991. 
The purpose of this alteration lstto add a 500 millisecond turn on time delay relay 
to each of the Wag fuel boost pump control circuits. The time delay relays (2 
each), located in the fiel pump control junction box (Right Main Landing Gear Wheel 
Well), will prevent boost pump failures that can occur, 
during electrical bus 
transfers (power interruptions). 
Installed the parts of ASC-134 kit in accordance with the instructions contained in' 
the above referred to ASC and Amendment 1, except, instead of using a CAS805A4 
splices (see instructions Figure 3, Page 8, triangle 2) installed a new Deutsch p/n 
DI-el-IA-02, plastic rail Terminal Junction (354A1TJ1) forward of relay 354A1K1 and 
installed two each new Deutsch p/n CTJ120E018 terminal Junction block* in the rail at 
position "K" & "L". Prepared the following wires for installation into the newly 
installed 354A1T.11 assembly by striping the insulation from the wire, crimp 
installing a new Deutsch CTS 520/20 contact onto each properly prepared wire with.a 
M22520/7-0i basic cool and M22520/7-,12 Xisliioner and inserting each wire/contact 
assembly as follows: (sire Figure J, age fs of the above referred to ASC for details) 
Wire No. 209000A20 to TJ1L-A: 209000820 to TJ1L-13: 059H2O to TJ1L-C: 1090005)20 to 
131K-A; 109000820 to TJIK-8: and 06'H2O to Ij1K-C. 
Removed the existing 354A1 CM, CR2, CR3, and CR4; p/n 1N4006 diodes. Installed a 
new Motorola p/n 1NO/84A iransorb transient spike suppressor in place of the diodes 
that were removed across each relay (354A1K1, K2, K3, & K4). Torqued and torque 
striped all 144 inch stud nuts to 25 inch pounds and all 6/32 stud nuts to 8 inch 
pounds. 
All added parts and equipment were purchased new for this installation and meet the 
requirements of the applicable parts of FAR 21.303 (b)(1)(2)(3)or(41-
Successfully performed the operational check out of the ASC-134's :.nstructions and 
the toaputerlmed Maintenance Program's Fuel Boost Pump Auto-change operational test. 
Measured each boost lumps current draw ((without any engines running) tc be 32 amps 
2 amps. Verified that the correct pump operated with respect to tte cockpit switch 
selection and bOost pump circuit breaker function. 
No changes were made to the aircraft's flight manual, inspection schedule. electrical 
load analysis, or continued airworhtiness inspection program as a result of this 
alteration. 
, • 
Recorded compliance with this FAA fora 337 in the aircraft's maintenance records. 
It has been determined that the interrelationship—between this change and.any 
previously Approved configuration will not introduce any adverse effect upon the 
'airworthiness of the aircraft. .This determination includes, but is not limited to, 
consideration that all normal. essential, and back-up systems will be able to 
function as they were intended and there wore no unique installations that might 
interface with this notification or•require deviations, to this ASC that change the 
priginel intent of the FM APPROVED design change. 
-7he effect upon the aircraft's .electrical load analysis and weight and balance were 
negligible and no changes were made to either report as 3 result of this alteration.
