I think if they are going to play the girls card we =hould be prepared to present the facts . facts no =onger seem to 
matter. . After a one year investigation b= the local police , . search warrants. trash pulls, surveillan=e. interviews of 
over 30 people. the case was presented by the=sex crimes prosecutor, to a GRAND JURY for indictment. . =AO The 
charge and the only charge that they returned was=for solitciation of protitution. no more no less.. =AO there was 
not a separate crime in florida for those prostitutes w=o were underage even holding themselves out of legal age. . 
Ev=ry girl that came to the house , came with the intent to make money =nd give an erotic massage. . each one. . =AO 
, The FBi , didnt like the result. so they strung together = and tortured statutes in an attempt to fit my cirucmstances. 
=C2 . The suggested that my assitants who answered phones or made =ails for me , could be charded with internet 
trolling st=tutes. as the phone is a " means of interstate comm=rce " and the girls would have been underage in some 
cases. =AO unlike internet cases where the " victim is either a p=liceperson or real child " they repeated say they are 
underage =o make sure the perpertrator acknowleges his understanding . - repea=edly. and says it over the means of 
commerce. ..C2 My assistants did nothing more than ask for the time the=girls would like to come and make thier 
money or " work " . =AO the telephone as a means of interstate commerce has been used bef=re in violent pimp cases. 
or using condoms that were bought in=another state. allowed a jurisdictional hook. . as=this count might not have 
been enough the FBI suggested using = travel for the purpose . ( an internatioanl travel prohibiotn to st=p internatioal 
travel for child prostituion _ there was no interstat= travel law) , when a perpertraotr had made =n appt to travel to 
another state to meet his find on the internet. =t was considered a confirming step. I never left my hous=. my house 
of 15 years. bought near my mothers house. =AO i had traveld down almost every weekend. 
= was asked to plead 
guilty in state court to being a pimp. ,=C2 the statute requires the pimp to have taken money from the girls. !!=/ my 
alternative was to fight a fed case. with sev=er mand min charges..
