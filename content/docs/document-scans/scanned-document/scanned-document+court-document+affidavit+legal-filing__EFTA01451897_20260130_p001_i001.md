SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
such investor complies with an applicable intergovernmental agreement pursuant to 
FATCA). The failure of an Investor to comply with these provisions may result in other 
adverse consequences applying to such Investor, including pursuant to the LP Agreements. 
An Investor may or may not be able to obtain a credit for or refund of any amounts 
withheld, depending on the investor's particular situation. 
Certain Non-U.S. Income Tax Considerations 
In general, the manner in which the Onshore Feeder Fund, the Offshore Feeder Fund and 
their income will be subject to taxation in countries outside the United States in which they 
conduct investment activities will depend, in part, on whether the Onshore Feeder Fund, 
the Offshore Feeder Fund or the Master Fund is treated as a resident or as having a 
permanent establishment ("Pt') in each particular country. No assurances can be 
provided that the Onshore Feeder Fund, the Offshore Feeder Fund or the Master Fund will 
not be treated as a resident or deemed to have a PE in one or more of the countries in which 
they invest. 
In general, if the Onshore Feeder Fund, the Offshore Feeder Fund or the Master Fund were 
deemed to be a resident or have a PE in a particular country, the Onshore Feeder Fund, the 
Offshore Feeder Fund or their respective Investors would be subject to net income taxation 
in that country in respect of the profits attributable to investments in that country. 
Additionally, the Onshore Feeder Fund, the Offshore Feeder Fund or their respective 
Investors would be required to file tax returns in such country. 
Assuming the Onshore Feeder Fund, the Offshore Feeder Fund and the Master Fund are 
not treated as residents or as having a PE in a particular country, dividends and interest 
received by the Onshore Feeder Fund, the Offshore Feeder Fund or their respective 
Investors from that country will generally be subject to withholding taxes imposed by that 
country. The rate of withholding tax may ultimately be reduced under the terms of an 
income tax treaty. However, as the status of the Onshore Feeder Fund, the Offshore Feeder 
Fund or the Master Fund is uncertain under many international tax treaties, the foreign 
payer may be obliged to withhold tax at full domestic rates, leaving the Onshore Feeder 
Fund, the Offshore Feeder Fund or their respective Investors to apply to the foreign tax 
authorities for a refund of any overpayment of withholding tax on behalf of those Investors 
that may be entitled to a refund. 
The Onshore Feeder Fund and the Offshore Feeder Fund will treat withholding taxes 
required to be withheld with respect to the Limited Partners as a payment to the Limited 
Partners to the extent the Limited Partners were entitled to receive a cash distribution, and 
to the extent such payment exceeds the amount the Limited Partners were entitled to, the 
Limited Partners will be required to make prompt payment to the Onshore Feeder Fund or 
the Offshore Feeder Fund, as applicable, in the amount of such excess. 
The Onshore Feeder Fund, the Offshore Feeder Fund or their respective Investors may also 
be subject to capital gains taxes in certain countries where the Onshore Feeder Fund and
