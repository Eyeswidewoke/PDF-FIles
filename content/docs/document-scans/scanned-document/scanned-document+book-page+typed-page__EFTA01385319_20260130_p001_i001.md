HY Energy Outlook 
Jared Weil, 
On market rebalancing on solid footing. but potential 
retracement in the cards En early 2018 
After three consecutive years of oversupply, the global 
oil market will likely a see a deficit in 2017, although 
slight (-0.18 mmbbls/d). The OPEC decision last month 
to extend production quotas sets up for an ultimate 
rebalancing of the market - supply and demand is 
expected to be largely balanced in 2018 and 2019 
though that would mean little progress in addressing 
the sizeable inventory surplus. That will come in 2020 
when the market will see a meaningful supply deficit (-
0.75 mmbbls/d) as demand grows, US onshore supply 
slows down and non-OPEC production declines. While 
the current rally in oil prices is backed by an improving 
fundamental outlook, there is potential for a pullback. 
The key near-term swing factor is US onshore supply 
and the outlook for that sector is turning positive -
drilling activity has bottomed while completions should 
pick up pace as significant new frac capacity (0.5-1.0 
million hhp) is coming. Production from US onshore in 
Q1 18 should drive the market back to oversupply after 
two quarters of deficit. 
This could drive a modest 
pullback in oil prices during 1H 18. Longer term, falling 
breakeven levels of major prospective projects (non-
OPEC. non-shale), especially deepwater, will likely keep 
a lid on oil prices. 
Between 04 16 and 03 17, 
breakeven Brent oil price (10% discounted) of major 
pre-FID projects have fallen from $53/bbl to $46/bbl. 
For new Canadian oil sands projects, 365 (Brent) could 
be a threshold for additional supply kicking in. 
US net gas 
normal winter key to absorb coming 
production surge 
For most of this year, the outlook for the 2018 gas 
market had been largely supportive of a $3 price -
driven by two factors: first, the expectation that by the 
2017-18 withdrawal season, the sizeable working gas 
inventory surplus would be whittled down, aided by 
flattish production and pop in exports, especially LNG. 
That has worked out with the inventory levels at a 
modest deficit (121 Bcf or 3% lower than 5-year 
average) by mid-November compared to a 265 Bcf 
surplus (15% higher) at the start of the injection season. 
The second was the expectation of a normal winter 
after two consecutive years of very mild winters -
warmer-than usual weather during first half of 
December has highlighted the downside risks to this 
thesis. 
Normal winter demand is crucial for 
maintaining S/D balance next year considering the 
market is set for an Appalachian-driven production 
surge in 2018 given significant progress made on 
takeaway capacity expansion in the Northeast. About 
4 Bcf/d of takeaway capacity has been added in the 
region between July and mid-November and another 
-4 Bcf/d of new capacity is scheduled to become 
Page 44 
operational by 01 18. EIA currently estimates YoY 
production growth of 6.2 Bcf/d next year. 
EIA's 
forecast of a largely balanced market and >$3 gas 
price is predicated on A) higher export demand (+1.65 
Bcf/d YoY) which is on track and B) a normal winter 
driving up heating demand by 1.42 Bcf/d YoY. If the 
latter fails to materialize, we could see price 
floundering below $3. This was highlighted in first half 
of December when 2018 gas strip went below $2.70 
after trading in the $2.9043.10 range for most of 2017 
- though it has since bounced back close to the lower 
end of the range given a strong revival in winter, 
especially in the Northeast and Midwest. 
H Y tied' approaching a 'Hormel' sector 
In the two years following the collapse in oil prices in 
2H 14, E&P players were focused on structural 
changes to the business model which could fit into a 
reshaped oil market. This included efforts to repair 
balance sheet (equity issue, asset sales) and large scale 
overhaul of the asset portfolio (mainly a shift to 
Permian). 
By early 2017, the revamped corporate 
strategies were largely in place. The HY Energy index 
is currently trading only modestly wide of the broader 
HY index (50 bps wider), a far cry from the >1,000 bps 
gap in early 2016. 
Meanwhile, oil markets in 2017, 
while volatile, had established a $40 floor (for WTI). 
With the oil market settling at the "new normal" range, 
the exit of weak players from the market and major 
sector themes (like the Permian Premium) having 
played out, the HY E&P group has been transitioning 
into a "normal" HY sector with standard credit themes 
like operational performance, cash flow models, and 
balance sheets allowing for greater differentiation. 
We focus on the cash flow model - a good proxy for 
asset quality - as a key differentiator for E&P credits. 
For the better quality names, our analysis focuses on 
identifying names with a 
superior 
FCF-growth 
equation. For lower quality names, we tend to focus 
on the breakeven oil price needed to keep FCF neutral 
in a maintenance mode, along with downside asset 
valuations. Based on the above, in the Mid Quality 
space, we are positive on WPX Energy (BUY-rated) and 
Oasis 
Petroleum 
(HOLD-rated) 
as 
they 
otter 
significantly faster growth through FY 19E with lower 
cash burn when compared with their respective peers - 
QEP Resources (SELL-rated) and Whiting Petroleum 
(HOLD-rated). Among Lower Quality oily names, we 
note that most names (with the exception of EP 
Energy), are well positioned to deliver neutral FCF with 
flat production at WTI oil price close to $50. Many of 
these names have driven solid improvements to their 
opex/capex cost structure in recent years driving down 
FCF breakeven oil price substantially.
