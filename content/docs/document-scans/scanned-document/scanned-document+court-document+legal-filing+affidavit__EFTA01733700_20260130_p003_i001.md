4. 
No Obligation to Complete Transactions; No Formal Business Relationship. 
Nothing herein shall be deemed to impose any obligation on either party to proceed 
with any transaction discussed in connection with the Business Purpose, and each 
party reserves the right to terminate discussions regarding the Business Purpose at any 
time. Nothing herein shall be construed to impose any obligation on either party to 
disclose any Confidential Information. This Agreement will not and does not create a 
joint venture, partnership or other formal business relationship or entity of any kind, or 
an obligation to form any such relationship or entity, between the parties. 
5. 
Ownership of Confidential Information. All Confidential Information shall be and 
remain the property of the applicable Disclosing Party. 
A Recipient and its 
Representatives shall not be required to return or destroy Confidential Information that 
is required to be retained in order to comply with applicable law or regulations. For the 
avoidance of doubt, any information retained by a Recipient or its Representatives shall 
remain subject to the terms of this Agreement notwithstanding any expiry of its term. 
6. 
No License. Each party acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained in this 
Agreement will be construed as granting any rights, by license or otherwise, to the 
other party to any Confidential Information or to any of a Disclosing Party's copyrights, 
trademarks, service marks, patent rights, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights, 
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. 
7. 
Equitable Relief. The parties acknowledge that the unauthorized disclosure or 
use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm and significant injury, the 
monetary effect of which would be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, the parties agree 
that a Disclosing Party shall have the right to seek direct injunctive relief against any 
breach of this Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies available 
at law or in equity for such a breach, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. 
8. 
General. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of 
which together shall be considered a single instrument. This Agreement constitutes the 
entire agreement, supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (both written 
and oral) of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and cannot be 
amended or otherwise modified except in writing executed by each of the parties. If any 
term of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder shall be enforced 
as fully as possible and the unenforceable term shall be deemed modified to the limited 
extent required to permit its enforcement in a manner most closely representing the 
intention of the parties as set forth in this Agreement. The provisions hereof shall inure 
to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of either party. 
Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any 
term hereof. The captions and headings in this Agreement have been inserted for 
convenience only and shall be given no substantive meaning or significance 
whatsoever in construing the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
9. 
No Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement or any of the rights, 
benefits or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party.
