ill. 
Resent the letter to Gary and cced you just now. 
#2. Today: Calling Jane Rosenthal/Craig Hatkoff for contacts for their 
accountants. Calling Jean Doumanian for same. Calling Cindi Berger- head of 
large PR firm PMK/BNC to get her accountant. Also Cynthia Swartz who owns a small 
pr company called Strategy. I will get all these names and contacts today and 
email them for appointments week of Jan. 7th. 
#3. Bryan told me not to do anything about replacing Darin till January or Feb. 
(So Darin can go to Sundance and sign up business....I am not an idiot) 
He was taken back when I told him I was interviewing someone yesterday as he was 
on his way to Thailand. 
I interviewed a smart 27 year old young woman with experience in movie pr and 
knows every player at every studio we deal with. This is extremely valuable. The 
kids in my office found her and have hired her as free lance to help at big 
events and like her. 
She came up yesterday.... and the whole office grilled her 
on aggressively going after films and sponsorship. 
She is great. They want her 
as do I. 
I called Bryan as he was on the way to the airport and told him to hire her. He 
said she can call him in a day or so after he got to his destination. He is will 
probably hire work out a deal for a month or so trail...that's his way of 
"testing" someone. 
He was very surprised I moved so quickly. 
I also told him either Jenna or I would go to Sundance. He said that was "not my 
thing"....as a protection to Darin. Darin has no intention of working with 
us...even if we need sponsorship...as Bryan says "the door is open". Darin has 
already called every studio to announce he is leaving. I have to call/email 
every studio head and Darin's contacts today and say we just replaced him. 
Bryan is thinking of letting Darin develop his relationships with young film 
makers that he says "I am not interested in" because I am away in Cannes writing 
my story...it's a lame excuse for "permission" for Darin to compete with me. 
After Bryan tells me Darin gave the company a young approach....now he tells me 
"that young is not my thing". 
Bryan is trying to run a new business for Darin on small films from Jan-
Sept....god only knows what he thinks I am doing during those months....he keeps 
giving me this bullshit that I will continue to do parties for socialite Kathy 
Rayner to "fill in". 
Then when all my big Oscar business heats up between Sept/Jan...he might be there 
to run that billing. 
Bryan can not work for both of us because it's a conflict of interest. Darin is 
a nasty guy who worked for Collen Camp, a crazy fat lady who was married to gay 
John Goldwyn (son of Sam,jr) and stole her roledex to come to me. He then worked 
5 years to make studio contacts on my name and try to start his own 
business...which I swear Bryan will try to finance and run. 
I also need a lawyer asap....to set my business as of new year under my name and 
not "Wagging Tail" and to take control of the books.
