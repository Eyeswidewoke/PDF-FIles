Nor in Mr. Epstein's case were there any of the allegations typical to sex trafficking offenses. There were no 
allegations that coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs or the like were involved in Mr. Epstein's case. And although the 
women who interacted with Mr. Epstein included persons under the age of 18, Mr. Epstein was not targeting 
minors, and, in fact, many were adults. The actual ages of the women involved have been inaccurately described 
by Plaintiffs' lawyers and unquestioningly accepted by the media without proper journalistic objectivity. Their ages 
have been misrepresented by photographs taken at times that do not comport with the relevant timeframes of the 
events in this case. Photos taken years before some of these women even met Mr. Epstein have been irresponsibly 
published by the media, along with uncorroborated stories of sex parties that Mr. Epstein never hosted. In fact, 
those who know Mr. Epstein can confirm that he rarely hosted any parties at all. And the story that seems to have 
gained so much traction about President Clinton visiting Mr. Epstein's Island was a total fabrication. 
All of that being said, Mr. Epstein's conduct was wrong and the resolution of his case after months of negotiations 
by well-respected attorneys on both sides was a balanced resolution that weighed the seriousness of the allegations 
against Mr. Epstein. However, it also properly considered the significant evidentiary challenges that prosecutors 
faced in this case, including swom testimony from many that they lied about being eighteen years old to be allowed 
into Mr. Epstein's home. And perhaps most importantly, it reflected a realistic assessment of the significant 
problem that a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein would have required novel and untested applications of federal 
law to what would typically be considered a quintessentially local criminal matter in south Florida. 
The conduct alleged involved a classic state offense and was treated exactly that way by able and honest 
prosecutors in Palm Beach County. Nevertheless, without any request from or consultation with those prosecutors, 
the federal government intervened. The United States Attorneys Office extensively and aggressively investigated 
whether Mr. Epstein had engaged in a commercial human trafficking ring, targeted minors, or used the internet or 
traveled interstate in the process. But that's not what this was, that's not what really happened and that is precisely 
why the federal authorities' ultimate decision to defer prosecution to the state was the right one. There was not one 
scintilla of proof that Mr. Epstein had given young women to his friends. Not one. 
Despite the substantial issues that the government faced if it chose to prosecute Mr. Epstein, the federal 
prosecutors insisted on various unorthodox requirements that Mr. Epstein's experienced defense team had never 
seen imposed on any defendant anywhere. Under the federally-forced deal, Mr. Epstein was required to request that 
the state prosecutors demand the imposition of a thirty-month sentence that included both jail time and the strictest 
condition of probation: lifetime sex-offender registration. Those draconian measures were far more than warranted 
by the state grand jury's indictment and would not have otherwise been required under the previously agreed-upon 
state disposition. As part of this highly unusual deal, the government required Jeffrey to pay for a highly 
experienced group of attorneys to bring claims against him on behalf of a government list of asserted victims. 
Jeffrey was required to waive the right to challenge those claims without being provided the asserted victim's 
identities by the government until after he was incarcerated. Now, more than a decade later, without understanding 
anything about what actually transpired, many are criticizing this deal for not going far enough. Importantly, the 
government's decision to decline prosecution in deference to the state in exchange for these extraordinary 
requirements was reviewed and approved at the multiple levels of the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Jeffrey took full responsibility and complied with the government's demands. He served his sentence, and in the 
process was subject to the same conditions concerning his time served and work release as any other state-
incarcerated individual. His conduct while in custody was exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial 
authorities. Jeffrey has paid his debt to society and strictly abided by the terms of the NPA, paying restitution to 
asserted victims who collectively received many millions from him. 
Our nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human dignity. 
Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the workplace. But Jeffrey's 
offenses of yesteryear, which were entirely outside of the workplace, have long since been redressed by the criminal 
justice system. He fully and faithfully has performed every promise and obligation required of him by state and 
federal authorities. In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances and fundamental fairness, that 
chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-productive and charitable life should be allowed to close once and for all.
