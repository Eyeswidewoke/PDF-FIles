Curriculum Vitae 
Mark Judc Tram°. April 2009 
• Co-Founding, Directing, and lecturing in the annual Harvard Medical School Continuing Medical 
Education course. Dementia: A Comprehensive Update (1997-current); during my turn as Director in 2001. 
I revised the course in collaboration with the Co-Directors and doubled its registration, thereby reversing a 
downward trend that caused some to consider discontinuing the course or changing the topic: since then, 
we have consistently received the Dean of the HMS Dept of CME's commendation as one of their highest 
rated courses; during my 2007 turn as Director we set a new record for registration. 
• Co-founding the Music Perception and Cognition seminar course (HST 725) in the Harvard-M.I.T. 
Speech & Hearing Biosciences & Technology Graduate Studies Program (2004.2(x7) 
• Supervising laboratory research and independent studies for over two dozen undergraduate students. 
graduate students, medical students, and neurology residents from Harvard, M.I.T., and outside institutions 
(1994-current); 
• Organizing symposia, serving on fellowship and grant application committees, and helping to build the 
MBB curriculum at FAS and GSAS as a member of the Harvard University Steering Committee on 
Mind/Brain/Behavior (2006-current) and the Standing Committee on Neuroscience/MBB (2000-current); 
• Organizing the Cognitive/Behavioral Neurology teaching curriculum at Massachusetts General Hospital 
for second-year Partners Neurology Residents (1995-2006): 
• Professional education via invited CME lectures and Neurology Grand Rounds (1998-current) 
• Public education via my contributions to and recorded appearances in the science museum exhibit, Wild 
Music!, which is touring the United States through at least 2009. and through public lectures (e.g., Carnegie 
Hall, Lincoln Center), materials posted on The Institute for Music & Brain Science website, and interviews 
published by print, radio, television, and Internet journalists around the world; 
• Middle- and high-school education via my contributions to the interactive edutainment DVD, 
Neuromairix. winner of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's 2007 Games for Health Competition. 
Clinical contributions include: 
• One General Neurology Inpatient Service rotation per year at Massachusetts General Hospital (1995-
current); 
• Outpatient Service in the Cognitive/Behavioral Neurology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital 
(1992-current); 
• Inpatient and Outpatient Behavioral Neurology Consults at McLean Hospital (1996-2005).
