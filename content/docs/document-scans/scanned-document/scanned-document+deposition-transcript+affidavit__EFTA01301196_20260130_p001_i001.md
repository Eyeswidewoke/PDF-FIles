"Last month, in a surprise move, Euro zone banks were given immense backing from their 
Central Bank (the ECB) via a lending program that supports them with three year money. The 
ECB and the Federal Reserve, despite different mandates, appear aligned and committed to do 
all they can to find a cure for what ails us. Between our Fed's QE2 and twist and the ECB's 
program backed by various types of collateral (even shorter term), the stage is set for an 
unprecedented expansive push to get the world going. 
While these Central Banks may have selected the only approaches available to address 
respective regional needs, recent actions are but the first steps on technically 
challenging paths that require dexterity and substantial follow through by government 
policy makers to avoid major pitfalls and ensure long term success. With awe inspiring 
fiscal deficits on both sides of the Atlantic, the Fed and ECB pursue strategies that can 
result in a potentially dangerous mix if governments lose discipline and fail to address 
budgets and debt levels in due course. 
A frequent visitor to Germany, I hear three things when it comes to the Euro zone crisis: 
First and foremost, there is a respect for and sense of accountability to all of Europe. 
Second is the belief that individual countries must control their budgets. And third, 
there is the conviction that the European Central Bank cannot be allowed to print money to 
lend to sovereign governments. 
Many Germans are terrified of runaway inflation because of what it did to their country in 
the first half of the last century. Runaway inflation is a crushing, relentless burden on 
society's most fragile. And it is set in motion at times when governments print money to 
avoid difficult fiscal choices. I am very sympathetic to these concerns because of my 
personal experience in the 1980s, living in Brazil and witnessing inflation's corrosive 
effect on that nation. 
It's said that the values of America's greatest generation were forged by the deprivations 
they observed and suffered during the Great Depression. Brazilians in their 30s and older 
vividly recall what it was like to live through an inflationary economic catastrophe caused 
by heavy handed planners and government led profligacy. 
Extraordinary yet understandable are the generations presently building Brazil (even their 
recent, leftist, Presidents), who for the most part support fiscal and monetary views that 
our great grandparents and today's conservative Germans would likely endorse. 
Governments often avoid difficult choices. And with all that's gone on in the past few 
years, it is amazing we can still find comfort in the assumption that, at crunch time, the 
right people will be imbued with the necessary special perception and deftness to hit all 
the correct buttons so everything works out just so. 
The Federal Reserve purchased over $2 trillion dollars of US debt during the past couple of 
years. Where does this money come from? And now, the Europeans are doing something similar 
to finance local banks and their demand for Euro zone sovereign debt. 
A week ago, the ECB ran its first auction of three year bank funding. More than 500 local 
banks borrowed US$635 billion in a single day. Although a portion of this financing 
replaced existing short-term funding, my guess is that, unchecked, ECB leveraging will grow 
significantly in the coming months. Both Central Banks have already multiplied the size of 
their balance sheets to record levels to get money to the public markets. At some point, 
there will have to be a change or there will be consequences. 
Paul Krugman once said: "Unsustainable situations usually go on longer than most economists 
think possible. But they always end, and when they do, it's often painful."
