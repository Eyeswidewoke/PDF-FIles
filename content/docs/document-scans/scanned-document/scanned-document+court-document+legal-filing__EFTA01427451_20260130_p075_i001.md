required, and bringing this facility up to full production will continue to 
require, additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our 
management and other personnel, which has and will continue to divert 
resources from our existing business operations. Even if our Heartland 
facility is brought up to full production according to our current schedule, 
our Heartland facility may not provide us with all of the operational and 
financial benefits that we expect to receive. 
Once our Heartland facility ramps up to full capacity, we expect it will 
provide us with in-house dry food manufacturing of up to 
30 million pounds a month and account for 50-60% of our forecasted dry food 
production needs over the next several years. Our Heartland facility 
is located in an area susceptible to tornadoes and other adverse weather 
conditions, and the damage or destruction of such facility due to fire or 
natural disasters, including tornadoes, power failures or disruptions or 
equipment breakdown, failure or substandard performance could severely 
affect our ability to operate it. Our Heartland facility and the 
manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult or 
costly 
to replace or repair and may require substantial lead-time to do so. For 
example, if we were unable to use our Heartland facility, the use of any new 
facility would need to be approved by various federal and local planning, 
zoning and health agencies, including the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, the Missouri Department of Health and the Missouri Department 
of Agriculture, and registered with the FDA, in addition to passing 
our internal quality assurance requirements which may take up to 18 months 
and would result in significant production delays. We also may not be 
able to find suitable alternatives with contract manufacturers on a timely 
basis and at a reasonable cost. In addition, we may in the future experience 
plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of regulatory 
issues, equipment failure or delays in deliveries. Any such disruption or 
unanticipated event may cause significant interruptions or delays in our 
business and loss of inventory and/or data or render us unable to accept and 
fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. We have property and 
business disruption insurance coverage in place for our Heartland 
facility. However, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover 
all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on 
acceptable terms, or at all. 
We may not be able to manage our manufacturing and supply chain effectively 
which may adversely affect our results of operations. 
We must accurately forecast demand for our products in order to ensure we 
have adequate available manufacturing capacity. Our 
forecasts are based on multiple assumptions which may cause our estimates to 
be inaccurate and affect our ability to obtain adequate manufacturing 
capacity (whether our own manufacturing capacity or contract manufacturing 
capacity) in order to meet the demand for our products, which could 
prevent us from meeting increased customer or consumer demand and harm our 
brand and our business. However, if we overestimate our demand 
and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets 
and may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our
