prospectus supplement) may be entitled to make a Section 988 election with 
respect to the Notes. If a Section 988 election is available in respect of 
the Notes, in order for the election to be valid, a U.S. Holder must: (A) 
make 
the Section 988 election by clearly identifying the investment in the Notes 
on its books and records on the date the holder acquires the Notes as being 
subject to the Section 988 election (although no specific language or 
account is necessary for identifying a transaction on the holder's books and 
records, the method of identification must be consistently applied and must 
clearly identify the pertinent transaction as subject to the Section 988 
election); and (B) verify the election by attaching a statement to the 
holder's income tax return, which must include (i) a description and the 
date of the 
Section 988 election, (ii) a statement that the Section 988 election was 
made before the close of the date that the Notes were acquired, (iii) a 
description of the Notes and the maturity date of the Notes or, 
alternatively, the date on which the Notes were sold or exchanged, (iv) a 
statement that 
the Notes were never part of a "straddle" as defined in Section 1092 of the 
Code, and (v) a statement that all transactions subject to the Section 988 
election are included on the statement attached to the holder's income tax 
return. If a Section 988 election is available and validly made in respect of 
the Notes, gain or loss recognized upon the sale or exchange of the Notes 
should be treated as capital gain or loss. Capital gain recognized by an 
individual U.S. Holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the 
property is held for more than one year and is generally taxed at ordinary 
income rates where the property is held for one year or less. The 
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Prospective 
investors should 
consult their tax advisors regarding the availability, applicable procedures 
and requirements, and consequences of making a Section 988 election in 
respect of the Notes. 
Due to the absence of authorities that directly address the proper 
characterization of the Notes, no assurance can be given that the Internal 
Revenue 
Service (the "IRS") will accept, or that a court will uphold, this 
characterization and tax treatment of the Notes, in which case the timing 
and character 
of any income or loss on the Notes could be significantly and adversely 
affected. For example, the Notes could be treated either as "foreign currency 
contracts" within the meaning of Section 1256 of the Code or as "contingent 
payment debt instruments", as discussed in the section entitled "U.S. 
Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the accompanying prospectus supplement. 
In 2007, the IRS released a revenue ruling holding that a financial 
instrument with some arguable similarity to the Notes is properly treated as 
a debt 
instrument denominated in a foreign currency. The Notes are distinguishable 
in meaningful respects from the instruments described in the revenue 
ruling. If, however, the reach of the revenue ruling were to be extended, it 
could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment 
in the Notes for U.S. Holders, possibly with retroactive effect.
