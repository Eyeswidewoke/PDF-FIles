2014 V.I. LEXIS 45, *; 61 V.I. 13, ** 
7. Divorce § 11.40--Division of Property--Particular Cases When neither party had 
made sufficient information available to the court to justify the division of their respective 
retirement accounts, but it appeared that they had about the same amount in their funds, 
each party was entitled to retain his or her existing interest in his or her account. 16 V.I.C. 
§ 109. 
8. Divorce § 11.70--Division of Property--Types of Property Interests Most states hold 
that an educational degree is not marital property. Courts have consistently considered 
whether one spouse had postponed his or her own career and educational goals to 
support and contribute to the career and educational goals of the other spouse. They also 
acknowledge the injustice that occurs after a couple collectively works towards the 
attainment of an advanced educational degree or career goal, the expectation of a higher 
standard of living in the future can be frustrated by the dissolution of a marriage. r.15] 
9. Divorce § 11.70--Division of Property--Types of Property Interests Many states 
have compared professional degrees to pension or retirement plans when establishing 
what constitutes marital property. Pension and retirement plans entitle an owner to a 
definite amount at a certain date, which an individual has a contractual right to receive. 
Professional degrees rely on uncertain future events and provide only an expectation of 
enhanced income. The value of a professional degree is speculative and dependent upon 
the attributes and future choices of its possessor to be fairly valued. 
10. Divorce § 11.40--Division of Property--Particular Cases The wife's medical degree 
was not marital property subject to equitable distribution, as the husband had not been 
compelled to delay or relinquish his own education or goals, he offered no evidence with 
which to calculate the value of the degree, and he himself had an advanced degree. 16 
V.I.C. § 109. 
11. Marriage § 1.50--Generally--Definition and Nature The Virgin Islands has long 
viewed marriage as a partnership or joint venture, whereby both parties collaborate for a 
common purpose and contribute toward its success. 
12. Divorce § 11.50--Division of Property--Power of Court The court has the authority 
to divide the personal property in divorce action even after a divorce decree has been 
issued. The trial court will be required to issue rulings on post-divorce ownership of 
personal property such as cars, boats, electronics, jewelry, shares of stock, bonds and 
monies deposited with financial institutions. 
13. Divorce § 11.40--Division of Property--Particular Cases Although there was some 
evidence that the husband in a divorce case withdrew $220,179.93 from his annuity 
between 2011 and 2012, there was no evidence that he deliberately destroyed, concealed 
or harmed the parties' property. The money was used to pay reasonable and necessary 
expenses, including expenses associated with his children's care, the marital homestead, 
businesses and living expenses; furthermore, the husband had been terminated from his 
employment and used his investments to support his obligations and standard of living.
