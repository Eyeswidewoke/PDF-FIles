Gentlemen, 
SAC agrees to fix all items listed on our pink sheets that are attached. We are still in the process of completing the audio 
level in the ICS and have agreed to lower the aft facing head rest so that window looking into the cockpit are more visible. 
All items on the pink sheets will be fixed by Monday January 7", and will be reviewed with the inspection team. SAC/KHC 
will send photos of the armrest tomorrow in the AM, Larry can look at it during the inspection next week and we will still fix 
any minor issues with the upholstery. The 75k was given in good faith regarding the quality of the interior, if you would like 
it all done over then SAC/KHC will rescind the 75k credit and use it towards new seats. I have also attached items that 
Larry had concerns with, this was sent to SAC in an email and we have answered these questions below. Most of the 
items are currently being worked and they will be inspected next week at acceptance. Some items are part of our 
standard interior and cannot be changed at this point without a major overhaul of the interior. Please let us know if this is 
acceptable and this is orgy agreed upon that payment is made by COB December 31a and the Acceptance of Completions 
is signed tomorrow also. 
Please see the responses to the questions below. 
item 1- Interior rendering notes side panel nickel trim, at this time it is not installed (only doors have 
nickel plating installed). Per Interior Sec Rev H pages 14-16 show plating on cabin doors only 8 nothing 
on fwd II aft sidewalls. 
item 2 - aft facing seat does not match the rendering, seat is at least 4 Inches to high. Presently looking at 
options to improve look & comfort of seat 8 request customer input. 
item 3 - fold down VIP arm rest is unacceptable in functionality and appearance ( starting with the 
retractable cord to poor stitching. Needs to be redesigned and completed. Presently reworking the 
upholstered portion of armrest & options of how to connect/ store Ipod & phone cables 
item 4 - complete interior stitching to simply say is un professional. Interior headliners 6 some other 
areas required more than standard seams due to the yield in customer supplied calf hydes. 
Item 5 - Volumne for IPod and cell phones Is low and requires amplifier installed. KHC has optimized 
volumes & are researching additional ways to improve the volume control. 
Item 6 - Lamb carpet as requested in spec was not supplied. Vendor claims sheepskin throw only 
available in "gray". Further attempt to fabricate in house are being investigated. 
Item 7 - interior rendering notes the appearance of solid indirect lighting,„Mr. Epstein did not like the LED 
lights and appearance of the DOT effect noted on the exposed lighting, including the entrance handle that 
reflected the light DOT's...please refer to rendering and then look at completed product. it appears as a 
cheap limo looking light effect. to quote Mr. Epstein. 
If these items are out sourced to another vender for a VIP quality interior, may I suggest I.J.I. Interiors. 
(International Jet Interiors, Eric Roth, owner), he has completed our Gulfstream and Boeing Interiors with 
the quality stitching we are looking for. The LED lighting is standard on all SILENCER Interiors to date. 
Item 8 - reading lights lumens are very low, The reading lights also have been standard on all SILENCER 
interiors to date. 
Item 9 • replace all cockpit Avionic face plates due to over spray and improper cleaning of surface, We are 
presently looking at options to resolve this issue. 
Item 10 - headset hangers un presentable to owner, need new engineering. These were designed with
