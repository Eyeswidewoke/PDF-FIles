The purpose of this alteration is to reduce the cabin pressure rate changes that cocoa dicing rapid power lever 
reductions at high altitude. This alteration provides an electrical circuit to reset bleed air pressure regulation from 
18 PSIG to 30 PSIG when the power levers are retarded below pedestal quadrant angle In • retarded power lever 
descent. without ANTI-ICE oft manifold pressure is maintained above 20 FS1G. This circuit is routed through the 
2500 FT AGL horn mute relay, disabling the circuit when this relay is activated Selection of any AN1T-ICE 
function also disables this circuit. 
ASC 313 INSTALLATION AND DEVIATIONS: Installed • new Death P/N 65009-001.513 relay socket into a vacant tad 
position near 32.3AIXKS8 and identified the socket as ASC31350: I instead of the relay, socket end thicket hued m ASC 313.
