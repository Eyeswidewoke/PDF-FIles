GULFSTREAM AEROSPACE CORP. MODEL G-IV, s/n 1085, NBBGA, TC Al2EA. 
refer to: Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. [CAC], FAA APPROVED, Optional 
Aircraft Service Change [ASC] Number 87, subject: AIR-CONDITIONIN2 
(ATA 21) Cockpit Display Unit [CDU] - Modification-, dated Octolird 5, 
1989; GAC G-IV Wiring Diagram Manual, Drawing number 1159/140,71-
effective for A/C 1060 & Subsequent, 30-2-1 Page 3, titled ENOIHE COWL 
ANTI ICE SYSTEM; note: this aircraft has GAC ASC 49 installer. 
The purpose of this alteration is to modify the Display Unit: [DU] fan 
circuitry to disable the fans when the pilot's, co-pilot'S, and Engine 
Instiument/Crew Alerting System [EICAS] display master stitches are 
all in the off position. This change also modifies the ?ewer 
circuitry for the display controllers [DC] so that th4y will not come 
on when the above switches are all in the off.positiol. This 
modification's design is only capable of disengaging the DU fans and 
shutting off the display controllers during ground 7peration. When 
the aircraft is airborne ASC 87's circuitry is locked out and the fans 
and display controllers perform their intended fwActions. 
Removed vire No. 2H31A22 from 318A1P10 n which is spliced to vire No. 
2028E22 and then removed vire No. 2H28E22 from 318A1P4 X. 
Removed vire No. 1H31A22 from 318A1P9 GG which is spliced to vire No. 
1H28E22 and then removed wire No. 1H28E22 from 318A1P3 H. 
Removed vire No. 2H31B22 from 318A1J10 n and vire No. 2H28D20 from 
318A1J4 X and connected them together with a crimp butt splice. 
"Removed vire No. 1H31B22 from 318A1J9 GG And vire No. 1H28D20 from 
318A1J3 H and connected them together with a crimp butt splice. 
The above wiring changes to the engine tool anti-ice circuits were 
done to remove unnecessary vire, connections and spices from the 
overhead console electrical assembly and free up electrical connection 
for ASC 8.7. 
Performed all of the applicable modification instructions contained in 
the above referred to ASC, steps A thru E and tested the ASC in 
accordance with the instructions Contained in steps Fl thru P20. 
Returned the aircraft to flight Status by recording compliance with 
this FAA form 337 in the aircraft's maintenance records, computerized 
maintenance program and retorting the ASC compliance card to GAC. ' • 
All parts that were 
were new and purchased from GAC Product 
Support. 
There will be no cockpiw procedural changes due to the incorporation 
of this alteration. ?Etre are -no changes to the aircraft's electrical 
load analysis. 
The effect of this efiange on the aircraft's basic weight and balance 
is negligible.
