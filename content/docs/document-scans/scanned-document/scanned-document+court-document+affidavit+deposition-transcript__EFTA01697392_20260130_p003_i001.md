Ritual and its resultant behavior are fueled by erotic imagery and fantasy and can be bizarre in 
nature. Most important to investigators, offenders find it difficult to change and modify ritual, 
even when their experience tells them they should or they suspect law enforcement scrutiny. The 
ritual patterns'of sex offenders have far more significance as prior like acts than the MO of other 
types of offenders. Understanding sexual ritual is the key to investigating certain sex offenders. 
The courts in this country have, however, been slow to recognize and understand the difference 
between MO and ritual.

The Distinction between a "Pedophile" and a Child Molester 
The general public, the media, and many child abuse professionals sometimes simplistically refer 
to all those who sexually victimize children as pedophiles. There is no single or uniform 
definition for the word "pedophile." As previously stated, for mental health professionals, it is a 
diagnostic term referring to persons with recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, urge; or 
behaviors involving prepubescent children. Technically, Pedophilia is a psychiatric diagnosis 
that can only be made by qualified psychologists or psychiatrists. Therefore, for many, the word 
is a diagnostic term, not a legal one. 
What, then, is the difference between a child molester and a pedophile? For many, the teas have 
become synonymous. For them, the word pedophile is just a fancy term for a child molester. The 
media frequently make no distinction and use the terms interchangeably. The term Pedophilia is 
being used more and more by law enforcement and prosecutors, especially in cases involving the 
use of computers. It has even entered their slang usage—with some talking about investigating a 
"pedo case" or being assigned to a "pedo squad." Although Americans most often pronounce the 
"ped" in "pedophilia" as the "ped" in "pedestrian" (from the Latin for foot), the correct 
pronunciation is "ped" as in "pediatrician" (from the Greek for child). 
• 
Not all pedophiles are child molesters. A person suffering from any paraphilia can legally engage 
in it simply by fantasizing and masturbating. A child molester is an individual who sexually 
molests children.• A pedophile might have a sexual preference for children and fantasize about 
having sex with them, but if he does not act out, he is not a child molester. Some pedophiles 
might act out their.fantasies in legal ways by simply talking to or watching children and later 
masturbating. Some might have sex with dolls and mannequins that resemble children. Some 
pedophiles might act out their fantasies in legal ways by engaging in sexual activity with adults 
who look (small stature, flat chested, no body hair), dress, or act (immature, baby talk) like 
children. Others may act out child fantasy games with adult prostitutes. .A difficult problem to 
detect and address-is that of individuals who act out their sexual fantasies by socially interacting 
with children (i.e., in-person or via an online computer), or by interjecting themselves into the 
child sexual abuse or exploitation "problem" as overzealous child advocates (i.e., cyber 
vigilantes). It is almost impossible to estimate how many pedophiles exist who have never 
molested a child. What society can, or should, do with regard to such individuals is an interesting 
area for discussion but beyond the role of prosecutors. People cannot be arrested for their 
fantasies. 
Not all child molesters are. edophiles. A pedophile is an individual who prefers to have sex with 
children. A person who prefers to have sex with an adult partner may, for any number of reasons,
