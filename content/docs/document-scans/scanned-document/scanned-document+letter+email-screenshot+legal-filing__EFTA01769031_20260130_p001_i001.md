Eyes only 
Hi Jeff 
This is a draft of what I wrote for Guardian. Any suggestions 
I met with DSK on Friday thel3th 2011 at the elegant Pavilion de la =eine hotel in Paris. Only 11 months had elapsed 
since the Friday the =3th in May when he had arrived at the Sofitel in New York. At that =ime, he was then leading 
Nicolas Sarkozy by almost 20 points in the =olls, As he told me, he had planned to announce his candidacy on June =5th 
and he had no doubts he would be nominated by the Socialist Party =nd was confident that he would be elected the 
next President of =rance. His had planned to make only a brief stop over in New York =hat weekend to see his daughter 
because he had a crucial meeting at 3 =M on Sunday in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. As the =anaging 
director of the IMF, he had come up with plan, codenamed =93Comprehensive," to head off a Greek default on its 
sovereign debt. =But to make it work, he needed German support. "If Germany backed =t, the other European 
governments would follow," he said. Otherwise, =he crises "would quickly spiral out of control and spread to Spain, =taly 
and other Eurozone countries." So, he planned to spend less =han 24 hours in New York. But, as things turned out, he 
would not =each Berlin. Nor would he run for President. Instead, he would be =ocked up in the grisly prison cell 
under suicide watch at Bikers =sland jail in New York City, charged by a Grand Jury with sexual =ssault, and forced to 
resign as head of the IMF. By the time, the =rosecutors decided that the only witness against him had been =ntruthful 
and dropped all the charges against him, the scandal had so =esmirched his reputation that his political ambitions had 
been =ffectively ruined. 
Yet, despite all that he went through in those 11 months, he =eemed remarkably optimistic, even buoyant, when I 
met with him. He =ad recently provided his analysis of the consequences of globalization =t an economic gathering at 
Kiev in the Ukraine, and, as far as I could =etermine, remained deeply engaged in the same issues as when he had 
=resided over as head of the 178 nation IMF. He came into the hotel =ounge precisely on time. He was dressed in a 
dark suit and an =pen-necked blue shirt that showed off a deep tan. I expected that =e might have been depressed 
after all that has happened to him, =ncluding his being charged just 3 weeks early with complicity in a =rench 
prostitution ring, but he showed no visible signs of distress =uring the two hour interview. He was determined to clear 
his name and =eturn to work as an economist. He spoke softly in perfect English, =nswering all my questions with the 
sort of lucidity one rarely finds =n American politicians. He made it manifestly clear to me that he now =elieves that 
what happened at the Sofitel did not occur in isolation =rom his political challenge to Sarkozy and his UMP party. Even 
if =he incident had not been planned in advance to entrap him, he =uggested that there considerable evidence that he 
had emerged =ndicating that he had been under surveillance and that what occurred =as deliberately "shaped by those 
with a political agenda" to =erail his Presidential ambitions. If so, his political opponents =ngaged in an after-the-fact 
conspiracy to turn what he termed "a =onsensual encounter" into an international rape scandal. When he =as put in 
handcuffs at JFK airport, and made to undergo the infamous =93perp walk," he had no idea how this could have 
happened to him. =ut now 11 months later, he has seen the Sofitel's closed circuit =ideos, electronic key swipe records, 
cell phone records and other =vidence that showed a great deal of behind-the scene activities during =is arrival, stay, 
and departure at the French-owned hotel. He had =ong been suspicious that his communications were being 
intercepted =y his political opposition in France. When I asked him about the =asis of his suspicion, he told me that 
there were many blatant signs, =uch as a copy of one of his emails to his wife Anne Sinclair found =tuck in a copying 
machine used by his political opponents. He said it =ad been found by an associate's spouse who was temporarily 
working =t the headquarters of Sarkozy' UMP party. Had he taken precautions, = asked. He said that his security staff 
had devised a sophisticated =ncryption system for his seven phones, and which had been installed =arlier that spring. He 
then explained that all these encrypted phones =topped working. "I couldn't make call on them so I had the =ncryption 
removed." This was prior to his May trip to America. =e acknowledged with a shrug that he may have underestimated 
the =angers of parties intercepting his calls and emails, but to him the =onvenience of making calls outweighed the
