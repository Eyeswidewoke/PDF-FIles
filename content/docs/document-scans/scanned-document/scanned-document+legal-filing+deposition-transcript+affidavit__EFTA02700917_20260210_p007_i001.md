splinters, cuts, or abrasions on his hands, or rust and tears in his gray suit, that such a descent 
would be expected to have produced. While climbing up and down ladders and scaffolding 
might present no problem for a young man in the peak of health, Calvi was sixty-two year old, 
over-weight, and suffering from vertigo. So even in the absence of any murder signatures on 
Calvi's corpse, the Italian investigators found in difficult to accept the alternative: without help, 
he killed himself. 
What was clear from their investigation is that Calvi had co-conspirators in getting to London. 
Italian authorities established that he had used three false identities, eight separate private plane 
flights around Europe, a speed boat, four different cars, and 14 temporary residences in getting 
into Britain. He had gone from Rome to Venice by plane, then to Trieste by car, where someone 
smuggled him in a speed boat to Yugoslavia. From there, a car drove him to a mountain retreat in 
Austria, and then on June 15th, he flew from a small airport in Austria to London in a leased jet 
disguised as a Fiat executive. The facilitator of this incredibly complex escape was Flavio 
Carboni, a well-connected Sardinian businessman. Since Calvi had previously used him to fixed 
problems, when he learned he was about to be arrested for bank fraud, he asked him to arrange 
his escape from Italy. To this end, he had given him access to about $19 million in numbered 
accounts. Carboni then employed Silvano Vittor, a cigarette smuggler, to be Calvi's bodyguard 
and driver. He also had two strikingly beautiful Austrian sisters, Manuela and Michaela 
Klienszig, help arrange the logistics. 
Once in London, Carboni and the Klienszig sisters stayed at a deluxe hotel, but Calvi and 
Vittor checked into an inexpensive suite at a second-rate residential hotel, the Chelsea Cloisters. 
Calvi used the alias "Calvino." It was the last place any witness saw him on June 18i6. When 
policed searched the suite the next day, Vittor was gone. All police found in the suite was 
Calvi's personal belongings, including his toilet kit and sleeping pills, neatly packed inside two 
locked suitcases, as if they were waiting to be picked up by someone. His black attache case was 
missing, however. Despite an intense search, Scotland Yard could not find a single hotel 
employee, taxi driver, or other witness to Calvi's movements that night (or, for that matter, the 
three days he had been in London prior to his death.) During these London days, he was"the 
invisible man," as Police Deputy Superintendent White told me. "We don't even know how he 
got from his hotel, four and one half miles away, Blackfriars Bridge. And we do not know how 
Calvi's body got onto the end of that rope." 
Even so, the coroner's jury in 1982, finding no evidence of murder, concluded that Calvi had 
hanged himself. But that did not end the investigation. In 1989, Carlo Calvi, Calvi's only son, 
hired Kroll Associates to re-investigate the case. After locating, authenticating and re-
assembling the original scaffolding that Calvi had been tied to. hanged from, forensic experts 
conducted a reconstruction in which a stand-in for Calvi, who was the same size and weight, 
walked all the possible routes along the scaffolding poles that Calvi would have to walk if he had 
indeed tied the rope and hanged himself. The stand-in wore exact copies of Calvi's hand-made 
loafers he wore that night. These shoes were then put in water for the same time Calvi's shoes 
had been submerged, and then microscopically examined by a former London police laboratory 
chemist. On every route, the chemist found that the soles of the stand-in's shoes had picked up 
yellow paint smears that matched those on the scaffolding poles. Given Calvi's weight, and the 
pressure of the shoe on the narrow pole, he concluded such tell-tale traces were unavoidable. Yet, 
when he microscopically examined the soles of the shoes Calvi had actually worn, he found no 
traces of yellow pain on the soles. Since there was no way he could have hanged himself except
