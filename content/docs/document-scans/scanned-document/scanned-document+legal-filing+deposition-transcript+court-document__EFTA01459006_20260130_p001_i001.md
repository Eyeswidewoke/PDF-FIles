6 December 2015 
Update: China Monthly: Rising challenges will trigger more policy easing in 2016 
months. We expect RMB asset volatilities in HI to 
remain subdued when most of these temporary 
market 
stabilization 
measures 
will 
be 
relaxed/removed over the next one to two quarters, 
and asset volatilities to renormalize in H2. 
• 
Balanced allocation between fired income and 
equity market While the asset allocation shift 
between equity and fixed income market should be 
largely driven by valuation, investment flows at 
domestic 
fund 
houses 
and 
banks 
(wealth 
management products) were quite volatile and 
extreme in 2015 with sizeable inflows to bond 
funds in Q3, however, the lesson from the equity 
market turmoil in July 2015 is that asset allocation 
by both institutional and retail investors needs to 
be more balanced between the equity and fixed 
income assets. In addition, considering growth 
fundamentals will remain sluggish, we expect both 
equity and fixed income market to benefit from 
flush liquidity and asset allocation demand. 
Furthermore, we expect the basis between the 
repo rates in the Stock Exchanges and the 
interbank market to narrow as the new IPO funding 
rules will be implemented in 2016 which reduces 
the risk of liquidity squeeze in the money market. 
As such, even in the event of equity market rally, 
we believe we are unlikely to see large outflows 
from the fixed income market into the equity 
market in 2016, which is supportive to demand in 
the fixed income market. 
• 
Reserve diversification inflows to MB bond 
rriarket. With RMB inclusion into the SDR basket 
effective on October 1 2016, and China having 
liberalized access to the interbank bond and FX 
market 
by 
foreign 
monetary 
authorities, 
supranational agencies and foreign governments, 
we are likely to see growing reserve diversification 
inflows to the RMB fixed income market. We also 
expect inflows by foreign institutional investors as 
RMB OFII program continues to expand. We 
forecast about RMB500bn bond market inflows 
from foreign investors in 2016. 
▪ 
Credit risk remains high amid supply risk in 2016. 
We believe the ongoing pressure of capacity 
reduction in certain sectors makes credit events in 
the bond market, the trust market and the bank 
loan market inevitable in 2016. On the other hand, 
measures to simplify issuance procedures and 
promoting direct financing (recently by the NDRC) 
in 
the corporate 
bond market 
allow 
more 
corporations to access the corporate bond market 
for financing. In our view, the combination of credit 
event risks and supply risk will keep investors 
highly selective in credit exposures. 
▪ 
Offshore MB CCS 
market. We expect the 
tightness in offshore RMB liquidity to persist for 
some time and we expect the basis between 
onshore and offshore money market rates to 
Deutsche Bank AG/Hong Kong 
narrow only after positioning in the offshore RMB 
FX market becomes more balanced. Offshore RMB 
liquidity renormalization is the key in reviving 
financing activities in the offshore RMB bond 
market. We forecast net issuance in the offshore 
RMB bond market to be modest at RMB50-100bn 
in 2016. 
find€ng ,Nrazegy. 
We forecast 10Y CGB yield to trade between 2.7-3.2%, 
10Y CDBs between 3.1%-3.6% in 2016 and 5Y NDIRS 
to range between 2.2-2.8%. Our curve risk is neutral to 
slight steepening considering liquidity and growth risk. 
We recommend trade the cash CGBs and rates in these 
ranges with a long bias. We expect cash bond market 
demand to be supported mainly by commercial 
banks/policy banks, 
fund houses and insurance 
companies. On onshore credit, we expect IG sector to 
outperform and recommend add allocation of liquid IG 
names. 
RMEi ii.reeildiess to cuntintio into 2016 
Following the 11 August devaluation, the PBoC has 
resisted currency depreciation via various measures 
ranging from FX interventions to the introduction of 
macro-prudential measures to limit outflows. In 
addition, various SAFE and PBoC officials have mooted 
the idea of introducing a "Tobin Tax" to discourage 
speculative trading. All are strong signals of the 
intensified official efforts to dampen speculation on the 
currency and slow capital outflows which have indeed 
been effective in the onshore market. Net FX purchases 
by financial institutions (including the PBoC) and net FX 
settlements and sales by Chinese banks on behalf of 
clients 
show 
that 
capital 
outflows 
have 
been 
decreasing. In October, net FX purchases by Fls 
increased by $2bn during the month. Adjusting this 
series for"fundamental" flows (October net trade 
balance and net FDI transacted in foreign currencies) 
suggests China's FX outflow in October was $49.3bn. 
This represents a third of the outflow during September 
and is the smallest outflow since July. 
Despite the slowdown in outflows in the onshore 
market, USD/CNH continues to trade weaker than 
onshore spot CNY, particularly in recent weeks. In 
addition, CNH volatility and risk reversal skew remain 
high. This is because the market continues to believe 
the authorities' resistance to CNY depreciation is 
inconsistent with the country's weak underlying 
fundamentals, monetary easing bias and capital 
account liberalization plan 
Hence, into 2016, we believe RMB depreciation will 
persist, albeit on a gradual basis. Why? First, despite 
the government efforts to slow outflows, we do believe 
onshore corporates will continue to remain active in 
repaying their external debt. This is due to (1) worry 
that RMB depreciation will persist and (2) ongoing
