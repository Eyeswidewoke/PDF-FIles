FBI: `We still have a pending case' 
0. EPSTEIN from Ill 
and Donald Trump among 
his friends
"Highly unusear is hoe: 
Palm Beach Police Chief Mi-
chael Reiter described State 
Attorney Barry Krischer's 
handling of the case in a 
bluntly critical letter to 
Krischer last year before 
Epstein was indicted. 
Reiter referred the mat-
ter to the FBI to determine 
whether any federa: laws had 
been violated. Epstein's afits 
countered by attacking the 
chief personally and profes-
sionally 
Reiter's department in-
_ ve-stigated Epstein for 11 
months. Police sifted repeat-
edly through his trash and 
conducted surveillance on 
his fivebedroorn, 74-bath, 
7.234-square-foot home on 
the Intracoastal Waterway. 
Police said Epstein paid 
women and girls as young 
as 14 to gve him erotic mas-
sages at his home. Polke 
thought there was probable 
cause to charge him with 
unlawful sac acts with a mi-
nor and lewd and lascivious 
molestation.

attorney Jack

A source dose to the case

pending a decision by the 
FBI on whether to refer it to 
federal prosecutors 
-we still have a pending 
case," FBI spokeswoman 
Judy Orihuela said Monday. 
caste Attorney Krischer 
did not return a call for corn-
meal. His spokesman. Mike 
Edmondson, declined to say 
whether federal irmistiga 
tors are delaying the Epstein 
race But, he added, "if an-
other agency is looking at 
something we wouldn't want 
to step on their toes' 
Attorneys say inertia in a 
criminal case often points to 
a pendingpka deal. 
 
1t wouM not surprise me 
if something has happened 
that's not reflected in the 
court fde," said Dinka, such 
as an agreement that will be 
formalized later. 
Defense attorney Marc 
Shiner said 
defense at-
torneys sometimes put off 
overtly conducting disco/. 
ery — deposing witnesses, 
requesting documents and 
the like — because doing so 
creates more work for har-
ried prosecutors who may 
become angry and not offer 
a plea deal. 
Sometimes defense law-
vers knowing that, will try 
and do discovery without 
taking depositions,' 
said 
Shine a former prosecutor 
for 13 pears. 
Instead they may conduct 
a below-thcradar probe such 
as having a private investiga-
tor check out leads, he said. 
Shiner and others say a 
plea deal for Epstein probably 
would result in pretrial inter 
station, in which a defendant 
may be ordered to undergo 
a psychological evaluation, 
Counseling or other condi- 
tions in return for dropping 
the charge. 
Edmondson, spokesman 
for State Attorney Krischer, 
said there is no plea offer 
and no request for the pros-
ecution to show its cards 
'lb my knowledge, its 
never happened before on a 
filed case, he said.
