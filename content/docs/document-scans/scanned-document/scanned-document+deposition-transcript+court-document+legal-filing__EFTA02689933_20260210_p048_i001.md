Unspecified Investments 
25.23 No assurance can be given that the Company (or any Compartment thereof) will be successful in 
obtaining suitable investments or, if such investments are made, that the objectives of the Company (or 
the Compartment) will be achieved. Investors will be unable to evaluate the economic merit of any 
future investment which may be acquired. Investors must rely entirely on the judgement of the General 
Partner, the Investment Committee and, as the case may be, the Investment Adviser with respect to the 
selection and acquisition of investments. 
Insufficient risk diversification 
25.24 During the Kick-off Period, a relevant Compartment may be exposed to a single investment. After the 
Kick-off Period, a relevant Compartment may be exposed to specific segment, asset class or 
geographical region and, hence, be susceptible to adverse economic or any legal or regulatory 
occurrence affecting that investment, segment. 
Foreign currencies and exchange rates 
25.25 The Company directly or indirectly may hold for the account of a relevant Compartment or Class 
assets in currencies different as the Reference Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
may therefore affect the value of Investments and hence have a negative impact of the performance of 
the Company, the relevant Compartment or Class which will additionally bear the costs triggered by 
the conversions between various currencies. 
Illiquidity 
25.26 Investments made by the Company for the account of a relevant Compartment shall generally be 
illiquid and consequently it may not be possible to sell these Investments at prices that reflect the 
General Partner's assessment of their value. The nature of the Investments may also require a long 
holding period prior to profitability. Consequently, disposals of Investments may require a lengthy 
time period or may result in distributions in kind of securities in lieu of or in addition to cash. in the 
event the General Partner makes distributions of securities in kind upon the dissolution of a relevant 
Compartment or Class or upon the liquidation of the Company, these securities could be illiquid or 
subject to legal, contractual and other restrictions on transfers; in addition, payment in kind shall be 
made with the consent of the Investor receiving this in kind consideration and shall be determined on 
an equitable basis amongst the Investors. 
Valuations 
25.27 Most of the Compartment's Investments will be highly illiquid, and will most likely not be 
publicly-traded or readily marketable. The General Partner will therefore not have access to 
readily-ascertainable market prices when establishing valuations of the Investments and the General 
Partner and the Company can provide no assurance that any given Investment could be sold at a price 
equal to the market value ascribed to such Investment in connection with the General Partner's or an 
Independent Valuer's valuation thereof. Actual realised returns will depend on various factors, 
including future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of 
disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale. 
Contingent liabilities on dispositions 
25.28 In connection with the disposition of an Investment, the Company (for the relevant Compartment) may 
be required to make warranties and/or representations about the business and financial affairs of the
