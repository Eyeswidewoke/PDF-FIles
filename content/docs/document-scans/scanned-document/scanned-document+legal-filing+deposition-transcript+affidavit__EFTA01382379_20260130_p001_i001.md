Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 
The following summarizes the most important terms of our capital stock and related provisions of the certificate of incorporation 
and our bylaws that will be in effect upon the closing of the IPO-Related Transactions and this offering. This description also summarizes 
the principal agreements relating to our common stock. Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all the information that may be 
important to you. For a complete description, you should refer to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the agreements referred 
to below, copies of which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. 
General 
After giving effect to the IPO-Related Transactions, our authorized capital stock will consist of 1,000,000,000 shares of common 
stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. 
Upon the closing of the IPO-Related Transactions and this offering, there will be 475,139,081 shares of our common stock 
outstanding (assuming no exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares), and no shares of our preferred stock 
outstanding. If the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, the number of shares of our common stock 
outstanding will increase by 9,795,918 shares. 
Common Stock 
Dividend Rights 
Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to 
receive ratably those dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of legally available funds. 
Voting Rights 
Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share owned of record on all matters voted upon by stockholders. 
A majority vote is required for all action to be taken by stockholders, except as otherwise provided for in our certificate of incorporation 
and bylaws or as required by law, including the election of directors in an election that is determined by our board of directors to be a 
contested election, which requires a plurality. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors and, prior to the 50% 
Trigger Date, the Designated Controlling Stockholder, are expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws and that our 
stockholders may only amend our bylaws after the 50% Trigger Date with the approval of at least two-thirds of the total voting power of 
the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in any annual election of directors. 
Liquidation Rights 
In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of our common stock are entitled to share equally and ratably 
in our assets, if any, remaining after the payment of all of our debts and liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding 
preferred stock. 
Other Rights 
Our common stock has no preemptive rights, no cumulative voting rights and no redemption, sinking fund or conversion 
provisions.
