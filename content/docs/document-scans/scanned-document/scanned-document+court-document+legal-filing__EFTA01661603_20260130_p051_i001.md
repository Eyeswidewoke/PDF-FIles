An Interview with Jeffrey Epstein

recognized authority on terrorism. Dr. Kushner has advised and provided training to 
numerous government agencies, Including the FBI, FAA, INS, and U.S. Customs. He 
is a frequent guest of all major television networks and is often quoted by news 
media worldwide. 
Brigitte Gabriel, a prominent Arab-American journalist, will provide a first-hand 
account of her experience with Islamic Jihad. Ms. Gabriel, a Christian native of 
Southern Lebanon, survived a bombing in which her family's home was reduced to 
rubble by radical Muslim forces. Prompted by the serious wounding of her mother, 
the family sought medical treatment in Israel - a place of refuge where the 
generosity and compassion of the people overwhelmed them. 
Robert Spencer, the director of Jihad Watch (www.jihadwatch.org), is the author of 
Onward Muslim Soldiers: How Jihad Still Threatens America and the West (Regnery) 
and Islam Unveiled: Disturbing Questions About the World's Fastest Growing Faith 
(Encounter). He is coauthor, with Daniel Ali, of Inside Islam: A Guide for Catholics 
(Ascension), and editor of the essay collection The Myth of Islamic Tolerance: How 
Islamic Law Treats Non-Muslims (Prometheus). His latest book, The Politically 
Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades), will be available August 8 from 
Regnery Publishing. 
Laura Mansfield is an author and counter-terror analyst. She uses her knowledge of 
the Arabic language and of Islamic culture and history to investigate jihad and 
jihadists both in the US and throughout the world. 
The location we have procured is of the highest quality and can accommodate in 
excess of 1200 guests. We expect to have a large contingent of first responders in 
the audience and are experiencing great interest, from this demographic, in both the 
tri-state area and southern New England. Surprisingly, a number of guests are 
planning to fly in from California, Texas and Florida. 
No doubt, the symposium will sound a potent, nonpartisan alarm - a warning which 
Is intended to serve as a "wake-up" call to all those in attendance. We cannot afford 
to embrace apathy or political correctness, not with this subject. 
NCC: I've read that the "First Responders" are very much involved in the 
symposium; why do those on the front lines of the domestic War on Terror so 
strongly support your efforts? 
Early on, a number of law enforcement agencies and military personnel signed up 
for our weekly newsletters. Feedback from several Sheriff's departments and Marine 
Corp Officers was encouraging since they proposed to incorporate some of our 
material into their training programs. PTF was recently contacted by a DO) official 
who praised our efforts and intends to both publicize the event and be in 
attendance. 
Bernie Kerik, New York City's former Police Commissioner and Congressman Tom 
Tamcredo (R-CO) both endorsed the event and are planning to be in attendance, 
schedule permitting. 
NCC: The People's Truth Forum put together some ads to publicize the symposium; 
could you describe these ads? 
The 60- second commercial was formulated to advertise the symposium. In 
summary, it began with Allahu Akbar (the Arabic phrase for praising god) and stated 
that these were the words heard in the cockpits of those four jets that crashed into 
the World Trade Center, Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. Then, the questions 
were posed as to what could have been going through the minds of those terrorists 
that day and what would have driven them to commit such an evil acts. . Next, we 
invited people to attend the symposium to find those answers and provided contact 
information.
