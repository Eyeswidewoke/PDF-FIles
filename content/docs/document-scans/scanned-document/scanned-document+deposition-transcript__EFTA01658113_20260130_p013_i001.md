Politico (7/23, Cheney, Desiderio, 4.29M) reports that, according to a newly declassified 
document obtained by POLITICO, President Trump's first intelligence briefing "as a candidate in 
August 2016 was led by FBI agents who had just opened an investigation into his team's ties to 
Russia." The document, "a seven-page summary of Trump's intelligence briefing by the agent 
who helped lead it, was filed as part of the so-called Crossfire Hurricane probe, the codename 
for the bureau's broader Russia investigation." DNI Ratcliffe "declassified the document, along 
with two others, on Thursday and sent them to Sens. Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Chuck Grassley 
(R-IA), who have been investigating the origins of the probe." The documents are the "latest in 
a series of disclosures by Ratcliffe to congressional Republicans seeking to support claims by 
Trump and his allies that the FBI investigation of Trump was politically motivated and corrupt." 
The Washington Times (7/23, Scarborough, 492K) reports a Republican congressional source 
said, "Every part of this FBI investigation stunk to high heaven, and it turns out even the 
defensive briefing of Trump was part of that investigation." President Trump told Fox News host 
Sean Hannity, "They spied on the campaign ... never been done before. They spied on the other 
campaign using intelligence." 
Fox News (7/23, Singman, 27.59M) reports the document "reflects type-written notes by 
FBI agent Joe Pientka after an August 17, 2016 briefing to then-candidate Donald Trump, 
Michael Flynn and Chris Christie, 'in support of ODNI briefings provided to US Presidential 
candidates and two of their advisors." The Daily Caller (7/23, Ross, 716K) reports Joseph 
Pientka, an FBI supervisory special agent, "conducted the briefing." The Justice Department's 
inspector general "criticized the FBI for sending an agent into the briefing, saying that it could 
erode trust that presidential candidates have in future dealings with the FBI." Pientka, "who was 
one of the top agents on Crossfire Hurricane, developed the briefing materials in coordination 
with Peter Strzok, the lead investigator on the Trump-Russia probe." Kevin Clinesmith, an FBI 
lawyer "found to have altered an email related to Carter Page, also worked on the plan to use 
Pientka in the briefing," according to the memo. 
The Washington Examiner (7/23, Dunleavy, 448K) reports Pientka quotes himself as 
telling Trump, Flynn, and Christie, "I will provide you with a counterintelligence and security 
brief that will give you a baseline on the methodology used by Foreign Intelligence Services to 
the detriment of U.S. National Security. In addition, this brief will advise you that if you are not 
already a target of a Foreign Intelligence Service, due to the fact that you are receiving this 
classified briefing, you will be." DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz "previously testified 
that this briefing was a 'pretext' to gather evidence on the candidate and his foreign policy 
adviser to help in their counterintelligence investigation." Pientka's notes "were categorized 
under 'Foreign Agents Registration Act - Russia, Sensitive Investigative Matter." 
CNN, BuzzFeed Call Government's Withholding Of Information From Mueller Report 
"Misconduct." 
Law360 (7/23, Subscription Publication, 8K) reports an attorney for CNN and BuzzFeed 
"claimed during a DC federal court hearing Thursday the federal government's withholding of 
certain details in witness interview memos produced by special counsel Robert Mueller's probe 
into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was part of its effort to 'paint a one-
sided picture' that would discredit the investigation." Charles D. Tobin of Ballard Spahr LLP, 
counsel for BuzzFeed Inc. and Cable News Network "in their FOIA lawsuits against the US 
Department of Justice and the FBI, claimed the government redacted certain information from 
the memos." 
Democrats Denounce Packets On Biden Sent To Trump Allies By Ukrainian Lawmaker. 
Politico (7/23, Bertrand, Desiderio, Cheney, 4.29M) reports "top congressional Democrats are 
sounding the alarm about a series of packets mailed to prominent allies of President Donald 
Trump - material they say is part of a foreign disinformation plot to damage" Joe Biden, 
according to "new details from a letter the lawmakers delivered to the FBI last week." These
