2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
In doing so, the court reiterates that Green Tree is not liable under this claim for alleged 
breaches by BoA. In addition, the court notes that there is no "free-floating" duty of good 
faith. Id. Instead, "the duty to cooperate exists only in relation to performance of a specific 
contract term." Id. In other words, the duty of good faith "requires only that the parties 
perform in good faith the obligations imposed by their agreement." Id. Therefore, in order 
to ultimately prevail on this claim, Mr. Steadman must point to a specific contract term that 
Green Tree did not perform in good faith. 
E. Negligence 
Green Tree argues that the economic loss rule bars Mr. Steadman's negligence claim. 
(Mot. at 13.) "Historically, Washington applied the economic loss rule to bar a plaintiff from 
recovering tort damages when the defendant's duty to the plaintiff was governed by 
contract and the plaintiff suffered only economic damages. Donatelli v. D.R. Strong 
Consulting Engineers, Inc., 179 Wn.2d 84, 312 P.3d 620, 623 (Wash. 2013). That rule 
"attempted to describe the dividing line between the law of torts and the law of contracts." 
Id. In 2010, ['34] however, Washington Supreme Court, "concluded that the term 
'economic loss rule' was a misnomer and renamed the rule the 'independent duty doctrine' 
to more accurately describe how [the] court determines whether one contracting party can 
seek tort remedies against another party to the contract." Id. (citing Eastwood v. Horse 
Harbor Found., Inc., 170 Wn.2d 380, 241 P.3d 1256, 1262 (Wash. 2010). Today, the 
"independent duty doctrine continues to 'maintain the boundary between torts and contract' 
in the place of the economic loss rule." Id. (quoting Elcon Constr., Inc. v. E. Wash. Univ., 
174 Wn.2d 157, 273 P.3d 965, 969 (Wash. 2012)). Accordingly, the court applies the 
independent duty rule, rather than the economic loss rule, to Mr. Steadman's claims. 
Under the independent duty doctrine, "an injury is remediable in tort if it traces back to the 
breach of a tort duty arising independently of the terms of the contract." Eastwood, 241 
P.3d at 1262. "When no independent tort duty exists, tort does not provide a remedy." Id. 
The Washington Supreme Court has limited the application of the independent duty 
doctrine to a "narrow class of cases" limited to "claims arising out of construction on real 
property and real property sales." Donatelli, 312 P.3d at 623-24. 
Additionally, the Washington Supreme Court has prohibited lower state courts from 
applying the independent duty doctrine to bar tort claims "unless and until" p351 the 
Washington Supreme Court decided that the doctrine applies to the particular tort claim at 
issue. Elcon, 273 P.3d at 969. 
Here, Mr. Steadman's negligence claim is predicated on allegations that Green Tree 
inappropriately serviced his loan. Mr. Steadman obtained the loan to purchase his 
residence, and the loan is secured by his residence. (See Not. Deed of Trust.) Therefore, 
this claim "arises out of the purchase of real property. See Donatelli, 312 P.3d at 623-24. 
The elements of a negligence claim are: (1) the existence of a duty, (2) breach of that duty, 
(3) resulting injury, and (4) proximate cause. Degel v. Majestic Mobile Manor, Inc., 129 
Wn.2d 43, 914 P.2d 728, 731 (Wash. 1996). Whether the independent duty doctrine 
applies to negligence claims depends on whether the plaintiff identifies an alleged duty of 
care separate and distinct from the parties' contractual duties. See Donatelli, 312 P.3d at 
623-24.
