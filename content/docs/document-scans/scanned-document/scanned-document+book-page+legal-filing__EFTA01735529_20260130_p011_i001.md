GIV/G300/G400 PILOT TRAINING MANUAL 
so, 
An additional function of this warning device 
is in ground configuration. If the trip temper 
ALIN is reached on the ground, a circuit is 
completed to the EICAS to alert crewmembers. 
The same circuit is completed through ground 
configuration of the nutcracker system to close 
the air-conditioning shutoff valve of the af-
fected pack. 
NOTE 
In flight, the switch gives a warning 
only to crewmembers. On the ground. 
the switch gives a warning and shuts 
off the air conditioning of that pack. 
Ground Air Conditioning 
Ground air conditioning presents additional re-
quirements to the system. On the ground there 
is no ram air and thus no coolant airflow across 
the primary and secondary heat exchangers. 
This airflow must be supplied: otherwise, the 
refrigeration equipment overheats. In addition 
there are times when air-conditioning system op-
eration must be terminated due to high demands 
from the bleed-air manifold, such as during en-
gine starts. Being a self-supporting aircraft, it 
must be capable of being air-conditioned using 
the APU even if the main engines are not oper-
ating. Airflow through the system when in 
ground operation is the same from the bleed-air 
manifold to the compartment outlets. 
Cooling Fan 
A turbofan is installed downstream of the 
ACM in the dorsal fin ram-air duct. The fan 
assembly, rigidly fixed to the armature of the 
ACK provides airflow across primary and 
secondary heat exchangers whenever air con-
ditioning is in operation. Air for cooling is de-
livered through the ram-air inlet in flight and 
a flapper valve in the refrigeration unit on the 
ground. All air is then ported overboard. 
Fightsafety 
Cooling Air Distribution 
Dehumidified, refrigerated air from the discharge 
side of the water separator is ducted forward, the 
main portion joining that part of the hot air which 
passed through the temperature control valves to 
become temperature-controlled air. Also, refrig-
erated air from the unit is ducted into one line 
which serves furnishing-agency-installed eyeball 
outlets. A check valve is installed in each line to 
prevent backflow. Provisions are incorporated for 
the furnishing agency to complete the installation 
to the cockpit and cabin, the number of eyeball 
outlets depending on the number of seats 
installed. The air from the outlets is dehumidified 
and refrigerated. 
RAM-AIR VENTILATION 
SYSTEM 
In the event of an emergency, the crew can ven-
tilate the aircraft by use of ram air scooped in 
through a dorsal fin ram-air inlet. A line is 
tapped into the ram-air duct just upstream of 
the primary heat exchanger. This line is routed 
to the ram-air check valve and then to the 
downstream side of the left water separator re-
frigerated air duct. If ram-air duct pressure is 
above refrigerated air duct pressure, the check 
valve opens and admits ram air to the refrig-
erated air line. Airflow moves forward through 
the cabin duct check valve into the distribu-
tion system. 
The check valve allows airflow to move only 
from the ram-air duct into the system ducting. 
In normal operation, with air-conditioning 
operation, duct pressure is always above ram-air 
pressure: consequently, the ram-air check valve is 
held closed, maintaining system integrity. 
Selection of ram-air ventilation is accomplished 
using the RAM AIR switch located on the over-
head panel. Placing the switch to RAM sup-
plies 28VDC from the essential DC bus to both 
of the air-conditioning shutoff valves. This en-
ergizes the valve solenoids and stops air con-
ditioning. As duct pressure drops, ram pressure 
predominates across the ram-air check valve 
and allows ram-air ventilation.
