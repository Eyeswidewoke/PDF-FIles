Washington to Wall Street as an avatar of the best of China and America, and of what their 
partnership can accomplish. With a presidential election approaching, both Donald Trump and 
Joe Biden should be tapping TikTok to woo young voters. New York bankers should be 
competing to list ByteDance's shares on US stock exchanges." He contends, "If Washington 
takes the drastic step of banning TikTok, the US would suffer as well. It would mean Americans 
failed to find a middle path between preserving their values and protecting their security in the 
face of ever-changing technology." 
China Criticizes Trump For "Double Standards" Over TikTok. Bloomberg (7/30, 
4.73M) reports China's government "blasted the US for flouting the rules of global trade and 
business by threatening to ban TikTok, in Beijing's strongest defense yet of ByteDance Ltd.'s 
viral video app." President Trump has "said he's considering blocking the popular music video 
app, while adviser Peter Navarro warned of penalties for 'information warfare' against the US." 
Asked about the scrutiny, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin "accused Washington of 
unfairly singling out Chinese companies." Wang told reporters at a regular briefing, "Recently 
governments and media in some countries have said double standards shouldn't be applied to 
social media apps. China's companies and their products have provided diversity of choices for 
US consumers. We hope the US can heed the voice from the market to provide an open, just, 
fair business environment for foreign countries and stop politicizing economic issues." 
DOD Inspector General's Uphill Battle To Create A Culture For Cybersecurity. 
Forbes (7/30, 9.71M) reports the DOD's Inspector General has "launched an audit of network 
security practices as more of the more than 1 million employees are working from home during 
the COVID19 pandemic." One year ago today the DOD IG "published a report to censure the 
military for the purchase of vulnerable Chinese computer equipment to the tune of $33 million." 
The report "called out DOD management's lack of accountability for cybersecurity and failure to 
communicate blacklisted products from Lexmark and Lenovo." The Audit of the DoD's 
Management of the Cybersecurity Risks for Government Purchase Card Purchases of 
Commercial Off-the-Shelf Items "describes $32.8 million in purchases of vulnerable and 
insecure computer equipment by the US Army and Air Force in 2018." The IG "observed how 
DOD agencies have repeatedly ignored previous cybersecurity alerts." 
Volunteer Experts Seek To Assist US Election Cybersecurity. 
NBC News (7/30, 6.14M) reports a new volunteer group "hopes to ease the cybersecurity 
concerns for free as election officials across the country prepare for November without knowing 
if they'll receive additional federal funds." Some states "pay private companies for 
cybersecurity, while others rely on in-house staff or federal assistance." But nearly all have had 
"to drastically rearrange their budgets this year to focus on holding an election during a 
pandemic, such as covering an influx of mailed ballots and buying cleaning supplies and 
personal protective equipment." With Congress still "debating what the next coronavirus relief 
bill will look like, and a proposal from Senate Republicans that offers no additional funding for 
election officials, states are anticipating the possibility that they won't receive any additional 
resources before November." DHS "offers state and local election directors some free 
cybersecurity services, and the Election Assistance Commission recently released a free online 
cybersecurity course." 
Portugal Telecoms Won't Use Huawei For Core 5G Networks Despite Lack Of Official 
Ban. 
Reuters (7/30) reports the three companies who lead Portugal's mobile phone market "said 
they would not use Huawei technology in their core 5G networks despite the government not 
banning the Chinese group from supplying critical infrastructure." NOS, Vodafone, and Altice -
which together serve nearly 100% of Portugal's mobile customers - "all said they had decided 
not to use Huawei kit in the core systems of their 5G networks, which covers servers, gateways
