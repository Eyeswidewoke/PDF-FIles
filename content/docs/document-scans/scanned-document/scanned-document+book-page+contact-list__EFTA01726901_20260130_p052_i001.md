Premium Global Assist® Hotline - Travel with Confidence 
When you travel 100 miles or more away from home, rely on Premium 
Global Assist Hotline for around-the-clock medical, legal, or financial 
assistance. For medical needs, American Express will provide you 
with a list of physicians and dentists in your destination, assist with 
travel arrangements if you need to get home in a hurry, and pay for 
the cost of emergency transport to a medical facility. You can also 
look to American Express for help with visas, passports, lost luggage, 
and more. 
Premium Global Assist Hotline must arrange all medical and visitor transportation. Because 
this is an assistance service, we cannot reimburse you for expenses you incur on your own.
