AGP LP 519 Alpha Group Capital Paul Barrett 
12. ADMINISTRATOR 
The Partnership has entered into an agreement (the "Administration Agreement") with The Bank of 
New York Mellon, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York, through BNY Mellon 
Alternative Investment Services, its alternative investment services group (the "Administrator), to perform 
all general administrative tasks for the Partnership, including the keeping of the financial records, 
preparation and distribution of reports and determination of net asset value, assisting the Partnership with 
its anti-money laundering obligations, including identification and verification procedures with respect to the 
Partnership and Limited Partners, and record-keeping procedures. 
The Partnership pays the Administrator a fee based on the Administrator's standard schedule of 
fees. 
Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator is obligated to exercise care and diligence 
in the performance of its duties thereunder and to act in good faith in performing services provided for under 
the Administration Agreement. Subject to certain terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator 
and its affiliates shall be liable to the Partnership (or any person or entity claiming through the Partnership) 
for damages only to the extent caused by the Administrators bad faith, gross negligence or willful 
misconduct. The Partnership will indemnify and hold harmless the Administrator and its affiliates and their 
respective directors, trustees, officers, agents and employees from all costs, expenses, damages, liabilities 
and claims (including claims asserted by the Partnership) and reasonable attorneys' fees and accountants' 
fees relating thereto, which are sustained or incurred or which may be asserted against the Administrator or 
its affiliate, by reason of or as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrator in 
connection with the provision of services to the Partnership. 
Under the Administration Agreement, in the event of any failure by the Administrator to provide any 
of the anti-money laundering services in accordance with its standard of care and not otherwise, the 
Administrator's liability shall be limited to the lesser of (x) the actual direct money damages suffered by the 
affected Partnership as a direct result of such failure and (y) the amount paid by the Partnership under the 
Administration Agreement for the providing of such services during the twelve months immediately 
preceding the month in which the event giving rise to such liability occurred. Any action brought against the 
Administrator for claims under the Administration Agreement must be brought within one year following the 
date on which such claim accrued. 
The Administrator may assign its rights and delegate its duties under the Administration Agreement 
at no additional cost to the Partnership to any affiliate of the Administrator. However, the Administration 
Agreement shall not be assignable by the Partnership or the Administrator without the written consent of the 
other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
The Administration Agreement provides that it will continue until terminated by any party giving to 
the other party not less than 90 days' written notice (or such shorter notice as the parties may agree to 
accept). 
The Administration Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to 
principles of conflict of law. 
13. TAXATION 
Federal Taxation 
The Partnership has been advised by its counsel, Seward & Kissel LLP, that, under present law, 
the Partnership will be treated as a partnership and will not be a taxable entity for Federal income tax 
purposes. Instead, each Limited Partner will be required to take into account for each fiscal year, for 
purposes of computing such Partner's own income tax, such Partner's proportionate share of the various 
items of taxable income, deduction and loss in the manner allocated to such Partner pursuant to the
