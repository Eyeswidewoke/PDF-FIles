Reports show Martinez still has lopsided lead in race for campaign cash The Santa Fe 
New Mexican (New Mexico) July 4, 2014 Friday 
According to Martinez's reports, the campaign bought television and radio time totaling 
$475,327. The campaign also paid consultant Jay McCleskey's company more than 
$64,000 to produce the ads. 
In addition, a report filed Thursday by RGA New Mexico PAC, a political action committee 
of the Republican Governors Association, shows that group spent a total of $571,290 on 
ads attacking King. That's $12,650 to produce the spots and $548,040 for buying the TV 
time. 
King paid Canal Partners Media, a Georgia company, $200,000 to produce and place his 
ads. 
As has been the case in past Martinez reports, a large share of her money came from 
Texas. Eleven of her 15 largest contributors were from the Lone Star State. 
New Mexico election law limits individual campaign contributions to $5,200 for the primary 
and $5,200 for the general election. So this is the last report in this cycle in which 
contributors could give as much as $10,400 -- as long as $5,200 of it was made on or 
before June 3. 
Martinez's largest contributors all contributed on that date. 
Those who gave $10,400 were the Republican National Committee; Associations Inc of 
Dallas, a media services company; Noble Royalties, an oil and gas royalties company of 
Addison, Texas; Compass Royalty Management of Addison; Jay Adair of Dallas; Marcus 
Hiles, Chairman & CEO of Western Rim/Mansions Custom Homes in Grand Prairie, 
Texas, and his wife, Nancy Hiles, who listed her occupation as homemaker; George Ryan 
of Dallas, CEO of Ryan Separate Partnership, which is involved in real estate; the National 
Shooting Sports Foundation of Newton, Conn.; and Diane Wilsey, a San Francisco 
socialite and philanthropist. 
Martinez also had several $10,000 contributors: Lee Roy Mitchell of Dallas, founder of 
Cinemark Theaters; Eloisa Hendric, an educator in El Paso; the Border Livestock Co. of El 
Paso; someone listed as "Director of Mural Technologies" of El Paso; and Edgar Medina, 
an account executive in Glendale, Ariz. 
Many of the top contributors to Martinez's campaign also contributed to Susana PAC, a 
separate political committee run by the governors political team. Among those contributors 
were Hendric, Medina and the Border Livestock Co. All gave $10,000 to Susana PAC. 
The PAC raised $70,811, spent $20,764 and has $120,814 cash on hand. Susana PAC 
contributed $5,200 to Susan Riedel, the Republican candidate for attorney general; $2,700 
to Secretary of State Diana Duran; and $2,575 to GOP Land Commissioner candidate 
Aubrey Dunn Jr. In 2012, there was a rift between the governor and Dunn because she 
didn't support him in his Senate race against Democrat Phil Griego. Apparently, that 
wound has healed. 
King had two $10,400 donors, rancher Ed Healy and his wife, Trudy Healy, of Taos. 
However, their contribution was made June 25, after the deadline. Ken Ortiz, chief of staff 
for the Secretary of State's Office, said Thursday, "If someone made two contributions of 
$5,200 after the primary, that would be $5,200 over the general election limit."
