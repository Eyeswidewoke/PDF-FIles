at any time while such failure continues, terminate the Transaction by 
giving written notice to Seller. On such termination the obligations of 
Seller and Buyer with respect to delivery of Purchased Securities and 
Equivalent Securities shall terminate and Seller shall pay to Buyer an 
amount equal to the excess of the Repurchase Price at the date of 
Termination over the Purchase Price. 
If Buyer fails to deliver Equivalent Securities to Seller on the applicable 
Repurchase Date Seller may -
if it has paid the Repurchase Price to Buyer, require Buyer immediately to 
repay the sum so paid; 
if Seller has a Transaction Exposure to Buyer in respect of the relevant 
Transaction, require Buyer from time to time to pay Cash Margin at least 
equal to such Transaction Exposure; 
at any time while such failure continues, by written notice to Buyer declare 
that that Transaction (but only that Transaction) shall be terminated 
immediately in accordance with subparagraph (c) above (disregarding for this 
purpose references in that subparagraph to transfer of Cash Margin and 
delivery of Equivalent Margin Securities and as if references to the 
Repurchase Date were to the date on which notice was given under this 
subparagraph). 
The provisions of this Agreement constitute a complete statement of the 
remedies available to each party in respect of any Event of Default. 
Subject to paragraph 10(k), neither party may claim any sum by way of 
consequential loss or damage in the event of a failure by the other party to 
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement. 
(i) 
Subject to subparagraph (ii) below, if as a result of a Transaction 
terminating before its agreed Repurchase Date under paragraphs 10(b), 10(g)-
(iii) or 10(h)(iii), the non-Defaulting Party, in the case of paragraph 
10(b), Buyer, in the case of paragraph 10(g)(iii), or Seller, in the case of 
paragraph 10(h)(iii),(in each case the "first party") incurs any loss or 
expense in entering into replacement transactions, the other party shall be 
required to pay to the first party the amount determined by the first party 
in good faith to be equal to the loss or expense incurred in connection with 
such replacement transactions (including all fees, costs and other expenses) 
less the amount of any profit or gain made by that party in connection with 
such replacement transactions; provided that if that calculation results in 
a negative number, an amount equal to that number shall be payable by the 
first party to the other party. 
If the first party reasonably decides, instead of entering into such 
replacement transactions, to replace or unwind any hedging transactions 
which the first party entered into in connection with the Transaction so 
terminating, or to enter into any replacement hedging transactions, the 
other party shall be required to pay to the first party the amount 
determined by the first party in good faith to be equal to the loss or 
expense incurred in connection with entering into such replacement or 
unwinding (including all fees, costs and other expenses) less the amount of 
any profit or gain made by that party in connection with such replacement or 
unwinding; provided that if that calculation results in a negative number, 
an amount equal to that number shall be payable by the first party to the 
other party.
