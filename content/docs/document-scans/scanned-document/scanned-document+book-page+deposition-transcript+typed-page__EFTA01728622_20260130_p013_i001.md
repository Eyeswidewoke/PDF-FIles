"Stranger Danger" 
Especially during the 1950s and 1960s the primary focus in the limited literature 
and discussions on sexual victimization of children was on "stranger danger" — 
the dirty old man in the wrinkled raincoat approaching an innocent child at play: 
If one could not totally deny the existence of child sexual victimization, one could 
describe the victimization in simplistic terms of good and evil. The investigation 
and prevention of this "stranger danger" are more dear-cut. We immediately 
know who the good and bad guys are, what they look like, and that the danger is 
external.
During this time the FBI distributed a poster that epitomized this attitude. It 
showed a man, with his hat pulled down, lurking behind a tree with a bag of 
candy in his hands. He was waiting for a sweet little girl walking home from 
school alone. At the top it read, "Boys and Girls, color the page, memorize the 
rules." At the bottom it read, "For your protection, remember to turn down gifts 
from strangers, and refuse rides offered by strangers." The poster clearly 
contrasts the evil of the offender with the goodness of the child victim. When 
confronted with such an offender the advice to the child is simple and dear—say 
no, yell, and tell. 
The myth of the typical child molester as the dirty old man in the wrinkled 
raincoat has been reevaluated based on what we have learned about the kinds of 
people who sexually victimize children. The fact is child molesters can look like 
anyone else and even be someone we know and like. 
The other part of this myth, however; is still with us, and it is far less likely to 
be discussed. It is the myth of the typical child victim as a completely innocent 
young girl walking down the street minding her own business. It may be more 
important to confront this part of the myth than the part about the evil offender 
especially when addressing the sexual exploitation of children and acquaintance 
child molesters. Child victims can be boys as well as girls, and older as well as 
younger. Not all child victims are "little angels." They are, however, human 
beings. 
Society seems to have a problem dealing with any sexual-victimization case in 
which the adult offender is not completely "bad" or the child victim is not 
completely "good." The idea that child victims could simply behave like human 
beings and respond to the attention and affection of offenders by voluntarily and 
repeatedly returning to an offender's home is a troubling one. It confuses us to see 
the victims in child pornography giggling or laughing. At professional confer-
ences on child sexual abuse, child prostitution is rarely discussed. It is the form of 
sexual victimization of children most unlike the stereotype of the innocent vic-
tim. Child prostitutes, by definition, participate in and sometimes initiate their 
victimization. Child prostitutes and the participants in exploitation cases involv-
ing multiple victims are frequently boys. A therapist once told me that a researcher's 
data on child molestation were "misleading" because many of the child victims in 
question were child prostitutes. This seems to imply that child prostitutes are not 
"real" child victims. Whether or not it seems fair, when adults and children have 
sex, the child is always the victim.
