respect of a Transaction or any assets or hedge incidental thereto, in Party 
A's good faith determination, has the effect with regard to either party 
of: (A) imposing or adversely modifying, in any material respect, any 
reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement; or (B) materially 
affecting the amount of regulatory capital to be maintained by such party or
