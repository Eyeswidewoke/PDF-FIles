252 Part V: Living the Good Life: Massage for Every Body  
Hydrotherapy treatments in luxury spas can also involve the use of super-
expensive hydrotherapy tubs, which look like a cross between a bathtub and a 
Jacuzzi. You don't need to be in one of these tubs to experience hydrother-
apy. In fact, your own bathtub or shower at home will do just fine. 
Here are a few ideas for taking advantage of your own water source to do a 
little hydrotherapy at home: 
 Bathe someone. For most of us, the last time we were bathed was in 
early childhood by our mothers, and we've forgotten how soothing it is. 
Using a pitcher, pour warm water over your partner's head, shoulders, 
and back in the bath. Then wash her slowly and luxuriously. 
 Take a cold plunge. Many spas have what's known as a cold plunge, 
which is a pool kept at a shockingly low temperature. Patrons jump in 
after being heated up in saunas and whirlpools. You can simulate the 
extremely Invigorating effects of this activity by drawing a cold bath and 
immersing yourself for 30 seconds (or. as long as you can stand it). 
 Share a bath with a Mend. First, make sure the friend wants to share 
the bath with you. After you determine that, slip into a tub of warm 
water with 10 drops of aromatherapy oll added, and see what happens 
next. It may not be entirely therapeutic, but it certainly will be fun. 
Exercise ... a day of pleasure 
The spa lifestyle is for everyone —unless 
unless 
you're the type who disdains pleasure and 
health, like the flagellant monks of the Middle 
Ages, for example, who used to wander around 
the streets beating themselves with sticks. If 
that's your idea of fun, definitely stay away from 
anything to do with spas. 
lf, on the other hand, you.have what it.takes to 
treat yourself to some healthy enjoyment in life, 
why not plan an entire day of spa pleasures? 
The sultans used to do it, and so did.Cleopatra 
with rose petals a foot thick °lithe floor of her 
love chamber. But how about you? 
You can recreate a day of luxury just like the 
ones people experience at spas. Trade each 
treatment with a lucky partner and spend.the 
day together. Then go out and celebrate your 
indulgence with a healthy meal at a restaurant. 
The whole exchange (not including dinner) 
takes about 5 hours. Just follow these simple 
steps: 
1. First start with a body scrub to cleanse the 
skin and prepare you to absorb the healthy

follow. 
2. Take turns soaking in a bath (or soak 
together if you're so inclined), with a dozed 
drops of your favorite aromatherapy oil or 
a few ounces of healing herbs added. 
3. Exchange long luxurious massages, fol-
lowing along with the step-by-step 
instructions in Chapter 11. 
4. Give each other a spa facial to prepare 
yourselves for reentry into the world.
