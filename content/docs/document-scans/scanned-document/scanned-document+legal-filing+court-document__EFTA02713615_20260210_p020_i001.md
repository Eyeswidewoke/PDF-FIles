their assets are invested in any one industry or group of industries), the Investment Manager does 
not establish fixed guidelines regarding diversification of investments to be followed by the 
Partnership. At any given time, the Partnership's assets could be concentrated in securities or 
asset classes that the Investment Manager believes offer an optimal opportunity for capital

as well as the Investment Manager's general risk management principles, which discourage 
concentrations, the Partnership's assets will usually be employed among a diversified set of 
strategies.

instruments of United States and non-U.S. issuers and to participate in other potentially

to: capital stock; shares of beneficial interest; partnership interests and similar financial 
instruments; mortgage-backed securities; interests in real estate and real estate related assets;

currencies; commodities; interest 
rate, currency, commodity, equity and other derivative 
products, including, without limitation, (i) futures contracts (and options thereon) relating to 
stock indices, currencies, United States government securities and securities of non-U.S. 
governments, other financial instruments and all other commodities, (ii) swaps, 
options, 
contracts for differences, warrants, caps, collars, floors and forward rate agreements, (iii) spot 
and forward currency transactions and (iv) agreements relating to or securing such 
transactions; equipment lease certificates; equipment trust certificates; loans, loan participations, 
and other obligations and instruments or evidences of indebtedness of whatever kind or nature;

contract and other claims; executor contracts; participations and sub- participations; assignments 
of rights under financial and derivative contracts; viatical settlements; insurance policies; 
pollution credits; money market funds; obligations of the United States or any state thereof, non-
U.S. governments and instrumentalities of any of them; commercial paper; certificates of 
deposit; bankers' acceptances; trust receipts; and annuities, structured settlements and similar

other strategies as deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager. The Partnership may 
provide seed capital or early stage capital, as well as negotiated capital, to one or more 
new or established Portfolio Managers. The Investment Manager may seek to enhance the 
return the Partnership receives from such investments through various contractual 
arrangements that provide the Partnership with reduced fee arrangements or an interest in
