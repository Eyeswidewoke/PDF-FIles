HEADLINE: PALM BEACHER PLEADS IN SEX CASE 
BYLINE: By LARRY KELLER Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH 
BODY: 
He lives in a Palm Beach waterfront mansion and has kept company with the likes of President Clinton, Prince 
Andrew and Donald Trump, but investment banker Jeffrey Epstein will call the Palm Beach County Jail home for 
the next 18 months. 
Epstein, 55, pleaded guilty Monday to felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 
18 for prostitution. After serving 18 months in jail, he will be under house arrest for a year. And he will have a 
lifelong obligation to register aS a sex offender. He must submit to an HIV test within 48 hours, with the results 
being provided to his victims or their parents. 
As part of the plea deal, federal investigators agreed to drop their investigation of Epstein, which they had taken 
to a grand jury, two law enforcement sources said. 
Epstein was indicted two years ago after an 11-month investigation by Palm Beach police. They received a 
complaint from a relative of a 14-year-old girl who had given Epstein a naked massage at his five-bedroom, 7,234-
square-foot, $8.5 million Intracoastal home. 
Police concluded that there were several other girls brought in 2004 and 2005 to an upstairs room at tte home 
for similar massages and sexual touching. 
The indictment charged Epstein only with felony solicitation of prostitution. The state attorney's office later 
added the charge of procuring underage girls for that purpose. 
Prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek said of the plea: "I took into consideration the length the trial would have been 
and witnesses having to testify" about sometimes embarrassing incidents. 
Epstein may have made a serious mistake soon after he was charged. He rejected an offer to plead guilty b 
one count of aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony, according to police documents. He would have 
gotten five years' probation, had no criminal record and not been a registered sex offender, the documents indicate. 
Epstein arrived in court Monday with at least three attorneys. He wore a blue blazer, blue shirt, blue jeans and 
white and gray sneakers. After Circuit Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo accepted the plea, he was fingerprinted. Epstein 
then removed his blazer and was handcuffed for the trip to jail while his attorneys tried to shield him from 
photographers' lenses. 
When he eventually is released to house arrest, Epstein will have to observe a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, have 
no unsupervised contact with anyone younger than 18 and neither own no possess pornographic or sexual 
materials "that are relevant to your deviant behavior," the judge said. 
Epstein will be allowed to leave home for work. The New York-based money manager told the judge he has 
formed the not-for-profit Florida Science Foundation to finance scientific research. "I'm there every day," Epstein 
said. 
The foundation was incorporated in November. Epstein said he already has awarded money to Harvard and 
MIT. 
When he is released from jail, there is a chance that Epstein will be forced to move. Sex offenders are not 
allowed to live within 1,000 feet of a school, park or other areas where children may gather. No determination has 
been made as to whether Epstein's home complies, but attorneys said it likely does.
