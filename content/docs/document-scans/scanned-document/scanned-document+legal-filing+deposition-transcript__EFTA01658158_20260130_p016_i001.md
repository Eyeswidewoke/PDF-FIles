information' of value to Chinese intelligence." 
Fox News (7/24, McFall, 27.59M) reports, "Yeo pled guilty to involvement in a scheme that 
used career networking sites and posed as a false consulting firm to attract American citizens 
with access to intelligence, who were potentially of interest to Beijing. Yeo originally worked to 
attract people from various Asian countries before focusing on the U.S. At the direction of 
intelligence officials, he worked to find and target Americans who had access to sensitive 
information, such as people who had top security clearances in the military and the 
government. 'Mr. Yeo admitted that he not only provided valuable information to Chinese 
intelligence, but also that he knowingly recruited others in the U.S. to do the same,' Timothy R. 
Slater, FBI Washington field office assistant director in charge, said."

nonimmigrant J-1 visa in October 2019, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern
