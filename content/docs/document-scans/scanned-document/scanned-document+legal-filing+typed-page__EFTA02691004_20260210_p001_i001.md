Italy 2030: how to stop the decline of the country 
(proposal for fellowship research program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government) 
Premises 
Despite the great potential of the country and its people, current Italian landscape is 
characterized by the following: 
- politicians with very short-term horizon, focused on next election only 
- political debate has gotten apersonal"; not addressing issues of national interest 
- politics and politicians lost credibility; unprecedented lack of leadership 
- past mistakes and current crisis, together with globalization process, raise several 
economic challenges and severely undermine future of young generations 
key economic trends are not promising: rising public debt, slow growth, increasing 
unemployment (specifically youth), aging population, poor infrastructure, increasing gap 
North/South, low social mobility, negative balance in global competition for talent 
widening gap between politicians' actions and economists' recommendations 
young generations are increasingly frustrated and disaffected with politics; politically less 
organized than older generations, their aspirations are not protected by politicians 
young generations have no dreams on their future, which reveals a society in decline 
There are premises for a political vacuum and unprecedented and fertile ground for change 
The project 
Focus on key economic topics and main reforms needed to stop the country's decline by: 
- gathering and analyzing the necessary economic and statistical data 
- interacting with economists, government and business leaders, to collect their views 
- summarizing existing issues, making them simple to understand and communicate 
▪ understanding and explaining what prevented politicians from taking effective actions 
▪ explaining long-term importance of addressing issues, although it may be unpopular 
providing possible solutions/policy advice and outlining strong and logical arguments in 
order to create broad consensus around them and facilitate implementation 
Key areas of analysis 
Public debt and deficit: public debt and deficit, respectively 119% and 4.6% of GDP in2010, drag economic 
growth and undermine future of young generations. Recent international financial crisis and increasing 
pressure on Eurozone make debt/deficit issues even more compelling. 
Labor market unemployment rate of 8.7% rises to 29.8% in 15-24 age group and to 42.2% among women in 
the South. Politicians have favored older generations - better organized politically - over young ones: ratio 
between unemployed in the 15-24 and 25-64 age groups is the highest in Europe (i.e. 4x versus 2.4x in 
Eurozone and 1.4x in Germany). Return on education (i.e. quality of the job and compensation) is very low. 
Fiscal pressure & *black economy": tax evasion and elusion create distortions in income distribution and 
undermine credibility of fiscal authorities ("black economy" of 8255bn on total GDP of 81,500bn); high fiscal 
pressure drags growth (highest "real" tax pressure in Europe with 52% of GPD net of "black economy"). 
Pension system: current system not sustainable. Young generations bear high pension contribution burden 
and will receive low pensions. Reforms in the '90s were very shy and young generations were not the priority. 
Liberalisation: in the country of professional associations and regulations, liberalizations are badly needed in 
many sectors, such as telecommunications, transportation, energy, banking, local public services. Also many 
"advantageous positions" need to be removed (e.g. notary public, lawyers, CPAs). Politicians are afraid of taking 
actions and lose votes short term. Area that allows to stimulate growth without increasing public spending. 
Civil Justice: Justice delayed is justice denied. Malfunctioning and lengthiness of civil justice (average of ten 
years for a sentence) has negative impact on overall economy and on ability to attract investments. 
Infrastructure: poor quality of physical infrastructure (transportation, energy, waste management, etc.) in 
certain parts of the country prevent investments, labor mobility and ultimately economic growth. Slow build up 
of technological infrastructure is becoming a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other countries. 
Social mobility/Education: traditional cultural environment not favorable to social mobility (family name and 
status perceived as more important than individual achievements). Lack of social mobility deeply rooted in 
education system (few merit-based scholarships; key education choices must be taken already at age 12; only 
10% of those whose parents have HS diploma receive College degree vs. 35% in France, 40% in the UK). 
Immigration: need to redesign immigration policy, focusing on current and future economic implications (labor 
market, pension system, tax income, social mobility) and leveraging on potential upsides.
