Declarant Control Period, the remaining parking spaces in the Condominium Parking Facility, if 
any, shall be Common Elements available for use of all Owners, their family members, guests and 
invitees pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ROA and any rules and regulations for such 
Parking Facility as promulgated by the owner of the Parking Facility from time to time, in its sole 
discretion. 
Section 7.6 
Leases Of Units. My lease of a Unit or portion thereof shall be in writing 
and shall provide that the terms of the lease shall be subject in all respects to the Condominium 
Documents and that any failure by the lessee to comply with all of the terms of such 
Condominium Documents shall constitute a default under the lease. No Unit may be leased for a 
period shorter than one (1) year; provided, however, that any Units which arc purchased by 
Wachovia, its affiliates or subsidiaries, may be used by Wachovia, or any successor by merger or 
acquisition, as executive residences for temporary use by employees or guests of Wachovia. This 
privilege is personal to Wachovia and its successor by merger or acquisition only, and shall not be 
transferable or assignable. 
Section 7.7 
No Timeshares. No interest in any Unit may be subjected to a time share 
program, as that term is defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. §93A-41(10). 
Section 7.8 
Animals. No animals, livestock, or poultry of any kind shall be kept or 
maintained in the Condominium or in any Unit except that small common household pets may be 
kept or maintained in each Unit, provided they are not kept or maintained for commercial 
purposes and provided that no Owner may have more than two (2) such pets at any one time 
(excluding fish). No pet shall be permitted upon the Common Elements unless carried or leashed 
by a person that can control the pet. All pets shall be controlled so as not to create a nuisance or 
unreasonable disturbance (including loud and excessive barking) in the Condominium. Pets shall 
not be permitted to defecate in the Common Elements, and each Owner shall clean up 
immediately after his pet if an accident occurs. All pets shall be registered or inoculated as 
required by law. Each Owner shall hold the Association harmless from any claim resulting from 
any action of his pet, and shall repair at his expense any damage to the Common Elements caused 
by his pet. If any Owner violates these rules more than twice in any twelve (12) month period, 
then in addition to any fines provided in the Bylaws, the Association shall have the right to require 
the Owner to remove the pet permanently from the Condominium upon not less than ten (10) 
days' written notice. 
Section 7.9 
Utilities. Total electrical usage in any Unit shall not exceed the capacity of 
the circuits for that Unit as labeled on the circuit breaker boxes, and no electrical device causing 
overloading of the standard circuits may be used in any Unit without permission of the 
Association. All clothes dryers will have lint filters, and all stove hoods will have grease screens, 
and such screens and filters shall be used at all times and kept clean, and in good order and repair, 
by the Owner of the Unit in which they are located. The Condominium will have a single meter 
for water and sanitary sewer service provided to the Condominium and the costs of such water 
and sewer service shall be deemed a Common Expense. The Association shall have the right to 
separately meter or submeter water and sanitary sewer service to any or all Units and costs of 
such utility service shall be allocated to the Unit for which such meter applies.
