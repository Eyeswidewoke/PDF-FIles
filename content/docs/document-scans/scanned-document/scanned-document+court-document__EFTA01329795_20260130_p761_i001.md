of this Agreement, but that interest shall not begin to accrue as to such $8,125,000 in outstanding 
principal until the expiration of the Waiver Period (as defined in two Aircraft Inventory Security 
Agreements, each dated April 8, 2003, one relating to an Extension of Credit in the original 
principal amount of $5,000,000, the other relating to an Extension of Credit in the original 
principal amount of $4,062,500), and the Borrowing Date shall be the date that the Extensions of

Amount of Extension of Credit. The amount of any Extension of Credit shall be 
equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the actual purchase price (subject to Section 1(g)(iv) 
below and to Section 9(c) hereof), excluding Taxes (as defined below) and other governmental 
fees, of the aircraft and related equipment being acquired or of the existing aircraft and related 
equipment being financed by Borrower or of the fractional interest in an existing aircraft being 
repurchased by Borrower from Customers, plus, in the case of a used aircraft and related 
equipment of which Borrower will, after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such 
Extension of Credit, own one hundred (100%) of the fractional interests therein, the amount of 
the Outfitting Allowance (as hereafter defined) in the portions and on the dates provided below. 
The Outfitting Allowance for each aircraft model type is subject to a maximum amount, as 
shown in Schedule B attached hereto (the "Maximum Outfitting Allowance"). 
(i) 
The term "Outfitting Allowance" for any such used aircraft shall mean 
the amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Procurement Costs in connection with the 
outfitting of such aircraft as set forth in the Procurement Budget (as hereinafter defined) 
for such aircraft and (ii) the Maximum Outfitting Allowance for that aircraft model type. 
The term "Procurement Costs" shall mean capital expenditures made or expenses 
incurred in connection with labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by 
Persons other than Borrower or Affiliates of Borrower (other than Raytheon) in arm's 
length transactions excluding labor, overhead expenses, and inspection expenses of 
Borrower and Borrower's Affiliates (other than Raytheon), Taxes and other 
governmental fees. The term "Procurement Costs" may also include any initial cost to 
enroll in an engine maintenance program ("Engine Maintenance Cost") in connection 
with the engines for a used aircraft being financed hereunder but shall not include any 
monthly charges associated with such engine maintenance program. For any Engine 
Maintenance Cost to be acceptable as a Procurement Cost, (i) the provider of the engine 
maintenance program must be reasonably acceptable to Lender and Lender hereby 
confirms that Honeywell and Williams-Rolls are acceptable providers; (ii) Borrower shall 
supply Lender with (A) evidence of enrollment in the program, and (B) with evidence of 
payment of the initial cost of such program to such provider, or with evidence that all 
conditions precedent to enrollment have been met except for payment of the initial cost 
for enrollment and showing the amount of the initial cost for enrollment; and 
(iii) Borrower shall supply Lender with a copy of the engine maintenance contract signed 
by all necessary parties thereto, which shall evidence a program whose benefits will inure 
(if the contract itself cannot be transferred) to the benefit of a new owner of the engines. 
In the event Borrower requests an Outfitting Allowance that exceeds the Maximum
