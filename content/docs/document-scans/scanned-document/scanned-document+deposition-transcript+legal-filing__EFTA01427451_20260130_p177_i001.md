Our Organization: "The Herd" 
Our company culture is an integral part of our strategy and one of our 
founding objectives is being a great place to work. We have a 
strong and dedicated team of employees we refer to as "the Herd," where each 
one of us is a "Buff." Our company culture is built on 
entrepreneurship, collaboration, a commitment to Blue Buffalo's mission, a 
competitive spirit and a friendly, casual work environment. As of 
March 31, 2015, we employed approximately 1,700 Buffs, including full-time 
and part-time Buffs, none of whom was represented by a labor 
union. We believe we have a good relationship with our team members and that 
our company culture is a key competitive advantage and a strong 
contributor to our success. 
We have a strong and experienced management team, with our founders playing 
an active role in the business. We have a deep bench of 
senior leaders with strong business and operational experience from major 
CPG and public companies across all business functions working closely 
as the Herd Leadership Team. Our Chief Executive Officer, Kurt Schmidt, has 
decades of leadership experience in CPG companies in the United 
States and overseas at Kraft, Wrigley, Novartis and Nestle, where he most 
recently led Nestle's $8 billion global Health & Wellness Division. Our 
President and Chief Operating Officer and co-founder, Billy Bishop, has been 
leading marketing and operations since our founding in 2002. Billy 
provides us with the unique perspective of an entrepreneurial business 
builder having helped build the SoBe beverage brand before starting our 
company. Our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Nathenson, has a deep financial 
and strategic background in CPG companies from his leadership 
experience at PepsiCo and Dean Foods, where he was most recently the Chief 
Financial Officer of the Dean Foods Dairy Group. 
Our Operations: Scaled Pure-Play in the Wholesome Natural Market Segment 
We believe our scale allows us to compete effectively against both our 
larger and smaller competitors. Being one of the largest pet food 
companies in the United States and the #1 brand in the Wholesome Natural 
market segment provides us with significant scale advantages in our 
supply chain. In September 2014, we commenced manufacturing operations at 
our Heartland facility. Once our Heartland facility ramps up to 
capacity, which we anticipate will be by the third quarter of 2015, we 
believe our hybrid network of owned and contracted manufacturing facilities 
will provide us with enhanced margin opportunities and greater flexibility 
in our supply chain. 
We focus on developing and marketing Wholesome Natural pet foods that we 
would want to feed our own furry family members. Our 
exclusive focus on pet products enables us to identify and react to trends 
early, develop Wholesome Natural products that meet the needs of pets 
and their pet parents and execute with speed and efficiency. We believe 
being a pure-play with this focus on pet products gives us a competitive 
advantage compared to most of our major competitors who are diversified CPG 
conglomerates. As the only Wholesome Natural pet food brand 
with a billion dollars of sales at retail, we possess operational and 
financial processes and tools that are difficult for smaller companies to
