professionals and 19 support staff. The INC Senior Loan Group currently manages over $9 billion in assets that arc 
substantially similar to the Collateral Obligations and Eligible Investments that it will manage for the Issuer across 
16 portfolios, including nine CLOs (including the Issuer). For the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, all 
descriptions of the investment process, personnel and duties of the Investment Manager refer to the ING Senior 
Loan Group within the Investment Manager. 
ING Group has adopted a formal restructuring plan that was approved by the European Commission in November 
2009 under which the ING life insurance businesses. including the retirement services and investment management 
businesses, which include the Investment Manager. would be divested by ING Group by the end of 2013. To 
achieve this goal, ING Group announced in November 2010 that it plans to pursue two separate initial public 
offerings: one a U.S. focused offering that would include U.S. based insurance, retirement services. and investment 
management operations, and the other a European based offering for European and Asian based insurance and 
investment management operations. There can be no assurance that the restructuring plan will be carried out 
through two offerings or at all. 
The restructuring plan and the uncertainty about its implementation, whether implemented through the planned 
initial public offerings or through other means, in whole or in part. may be disruptive to the business of the 
Investment Manager. including, among other things. an interruption of or reduction in the Investment Manager's 
business and services, diversion of management's attention from day-to-day operations, and loss of key employees 
or customers. A failure to complete the offerings or other means of implementation on favorable terms could have a 
material adverse impact on the operations of the Investment Manager. The restructuring plan may result in the 
Investment Manager's loss of access to services and resources of ING Group and it other subsidiaries, which could 
adversely affect its businesses and profitability. Currently, the Investment Manager does not anticipate that the 
restructuring will have a material adverse impact on its operations or on its ability• to perform the services required 
under the Investment Management Agreement and this Indenture. 
Investment Process 
The Investment Manager employs a disciplined process to identify. analyze. purchase and monitor investments. 
This process begins with macroeconomic research. The Investment Manager continually monitors world events. 
interest rate trends, domestic and global economic cycles and other economic variables. This research helps the 
Investment Manager identify industries for further review and analysis. 
Once industries have been identified for further review and analysis, the Investment Manager analyzes those 
industries in terms of whether they are cyclical or non-cyclical, production or distribution, durable or non-durable, 
integrated or non-integrated, industrial or consumer, domestic or international, and analyzes their capital flows, 
developing trends, pricing power and supply/demand dynamics. 
Fundamental credit analysis is the foundation of the Investment Manager's portfolio construction. The Investment 
Manager analyzes potential investments with respect to both the individual company and the deal structure. 
Fundamental credit analysis of a company is an in-depth. independent analysis focused on free cash flow generation 
liquidity and adequacy of collateral coverage. In addition. the Investment Manager evaluates a company's 
management. its competitive position. its market share within its industiy, and the strengths and weaknesses of its 
business segments. 
The Investment Manager's review of the structure of a proposed investment focuses on the provisions of the credit 
documents, particularly the strength of the protective covenants and the voting rights of lenders. The Investment 
Manager also analyzes the sponsors of the transaction to determine whether they are proven, committed. and have 
the finarcial resources required to support the company if necessary•. 
Proposed investments that are recommended after the foregoing review and analysis are presented to the Investment 
Manager's Investment Committee. The Investment Committee is comprised of the ING Senior Loan Group's two 
group heads and a senior credit officer. The Investment Committee approves all new credit exposure, sets maximum 
per issuer credit limits and makes portfolio allocations. It also oversees secondary trading and compliance. validates 
credit scores, sets trading policy and provides approval of regular quarterly monitoring. All investment decisions of 
the Investment Committee must receive majority approval.
