Jeffrey Epstein 
he is winning. Whether in conversations or 
negotiations, he alums stands back and lets 
the other person determine the style and 
manner of the conversation or negotiation. 
And then he responds in their style. Jeffrey 
sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick 
a fight, but if there is a fight, he will let you 
choose your weapon." 
One case is rather more serious. Currently, 
Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on 
loans from its private-banking arm for 520 
million: Epstein claims that Citibank "fraud-
ulently induced" him into borrowing the 
money for inveamems. Citibank disputes this 
charge. 
The legal papers kit another case offer a 
rare window into Epstein's finances. In 1995. 
Epstein stopped paying rent to his landlord, 
the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society. kit his 
office in the Ydlard House. He claimed that 
they were breaking the terms of the lease by 
not letting his staff in at night. The case was 
esentually senkd. However. one of the papas 
filed in this dispute is Epstein's financial state-
ment for 1988. in Much he claimed to be 
worth S20 million. He listed that he owned 
57 million in securities. SI million in cash. 
zero in residential property (although he 
told sources that he had already bought the 
home in Palm Beach). and 511 million in 
other assets. including his investment in 
Riddell. A co-inwstor in Riddell says: "The 
company had been bought with a huge 
amount of debt. and it wasn't public. so it 
was meaningless to anach a figure like that to 
it ... the price it cost was about 51.2 mi4 
lion." The co-imestors bought out Epstein's 
share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately 
S3 million. At that time. when Epstein was 
asked. as a routine matter. to sign a paper 
guaranteeing he had access to a few million 
dollars in case of any subsequent disputes 
over the sale price. Wexner signed for him. 
Epstein has explained that this was because 
the co-investors wanted an indemnity against 
being sued by Wexner. One of the investors 
calls this "bullshit." 
E
pstein's appointment to the board of 
New York's Rockefeller University in 
2000 brought him into greater social promi-
nence. Boasting such social names as Nancy 
Kissinger Brooke Astor, and Robert Bass. 
the board also includes such preeminent 
scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph Gold-
stein. "Epstein was thrilled to be elected." 
says someone who knows him. 
Alter one term Epstein resigned. Accord-
ing to New Mc magazine, this was because 
he didn't late to wear a suit to meetings. A 
•-ikttption to' the Rockefeller board says 
was -arrogant" and "not a good fit." The 
spokesperson admits that it is "infrequent" 
for board members not to be renominated 
after only one term. 
Still, the recent spate of publicity Ep-
stein has inspired does not seem to have 
fazed him. In November he was spotted in 
the front row of the Victoria's Secret fashion 
show at New York's Lexington Avenue Ar-
mory; around the same lime the usual co-
terie of friends and beautiful women were 
whisked off to Little St. James (which he 
tells people has been renamed Little St. Jeff) 
for a long weekend. 
Thanks to Epstein's introductions, says 
Martin Nowak. the biologist finds himself 
moving from Princeton to Harvard. where 
he is assuming the joint position of profes-
sor of mathematics and professor of biolo-
gy. Epstein has pledged at least S25 million 
to Harvard to create the Epstein Program 
for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary 
Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office 
at the university. The program wig be dedi-
cated to searching kr natures algorithms. a 
pursuit that is a specialty of Novak's. For 
Epstein this mus: be the summit of every-
thing he has worked toward: he has been 
seen proudly displaying Harvard president 
Larry Summers's letter of commitment as 
if he can't quite believe it is real. He says he 
was reluctant to have his name attached to 
the program. but Summers persuaded him. 
He rang his mentor Werner about it. and 
Wane( told him it was all right. 
An insatiable. restless snarl. always on the 
move. Epstein builds a tremendous amount 
of downtime into his hectic work schedule. 
Yet there is something almost programmed 
about his relaxation: it's as if even plea-
sure has to be measured in terms of self-
improvement. Nowak says that. when he 
goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean, 
they'll get up at six and. as the sun rises. 
have threeshour conversations about theorto 
ical physics. "Then he'll go off and do some 
work. re-appear, and we'll talk some more." 
Another person who went to the island 
with Epstein. Maxwell. and astral beautiful 
women remembers that the women -sat 
around one night teasing him about the 
kinds of grasping women who might want 
to date him. He vas amused by the idea. . .. 
He's like a king in his own maid." 
Many people comment there is some-
thing innocent. almost childlike about Jef-
frey Epstein They see the as refreshing. given 
the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan 
Dershowitz says that. as he was getting to 
know Epstein. his wok asked him if he would 
still be close to him if Epstein sudden!), filed 
for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied. 
"Absolutely. I would be as interested in him 
as a friend if we had hamburgers on the 
lifilgiarcause he had insufficient time
