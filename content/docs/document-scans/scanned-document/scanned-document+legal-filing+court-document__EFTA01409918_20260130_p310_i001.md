Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
US FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-US HOLDERS 
The following is a general discussion of the material US federal income and 
estate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of 
common stock by a "non-US holder." A "non-US holder" is a beneficial owner 
of a share of our common stock that is, for US federal income tax 
purposes: 
• a non-resident alien individual, other than a former citizen or resident 
of the United States subject to US tax as an expatriate, 
• 
a foreign corporation, or 
• 
a foreign estate or trust. 
If a partnership or other pass-through entity (including an entity or 
arrangement treated as a partnership or other type of pass-through entity for 
US federal income tax purposes) owns our common stock, the tax treatment of 
a partner or beneficial owner of the entity may depend upon the 
status of the owner, the activities of the entity and certain determinations 
made at the partner or beneficial owner level. Partners and beneficial 
owners in partnerships or other pass-through entities that own our common 
stock should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular US 
federal income and estate tax consequences applicable to them. 
This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 
or the Code, and administrative pronouncements, judicial 
decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations, changes to 
any of which subsequent to the date of this prospectus may affect the 
tax consequences described herein (possibly with retroactive effect). This 
discussion does not address all aspects of US federal income and estate 
taxation that may be relevant to non-US holders in light of their particular 
circumstances and does not address any tax consequences arising under 
the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction. Prospective holders 
are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the particular tax 
consequences to them of owning and disposing of our common stock, including 
the consequences under the laws of any state, local or foreign 
jurisdiction. 
Dividends 
As discussed under "Dividend Policy" above, we do not currently expect to 
pay dividends. In the event that we do pay dividends out of our 
current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under US federal 
income tax principles), such dividends paid to a non-US holder 
generally will be subject to US federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, or a 
reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty. In order to 
obtain a reduced rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty, 
a non-US holder generally will be required to provide an Internal 
Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, 
certifying its entitlement to benefits under the treaty. 
No amounts in respect of US federal withholding tax will be withheld from 
dividends paid to a non-US holder if the non-US holder provides 
an IRS Form W-8ECI certifying that the dividends are effectively connected 
with the non-US holder's conduct of a trade or business within the
