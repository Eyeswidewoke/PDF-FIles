products or must increase promotional activity, our margins may be adversely 
affected. Furthermore, price increases generally result in volume 
losses, as consumers purchase fewer units. If such losses are greater than 
expected or if we lose distribution due to a price increase, our business, 
financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely 
affected. 
If our products are alleged to cause injury or illness or fail to comply 
with governmental regulations, we may need to recall our products and 
may experience product liability claims. 
Our products may be exposed to product recalls, including voluntary recalls 
or withdrawals, if they are alleged to pose a risk of injury or 
illness, or if they are alleged to have been mislabeled, misbranded or 
adulterated or to otherwise be in violation of governmental regulations. We 
may also voluntarily recall or withdraw products in order to protect our 
brand or reputation if we determine that they do not meet our standards, 
whether for palatability, appearance or otherwise. In 2010, we voluntarily 
issued a recall of certain of our products due to possible excess Vitamin 
D present in specific production runs caused by an error occurring at an 
ingredient supplier. This recall resulted in a reduction to net sales and the 
incurrence of incremental expenses in 2010. If there is any future product 
recall or withdrawal, it could result in substantial and unexpected 
expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to our reputation and 
lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time, 
and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be 
materially adversely affected. 
We also may be subject to product liability claims if the consumption or use 
of our products is alleged to cause injury or illness. While we 
carry product liability insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to 
cover all liabilities that we may incur in connection with product liability 
claims. For example, punitive damages are generally not covered by 
insurance. If we are subject to substantial product liability claims in the 
future, 
we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance, obtain 
comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, or secure additional 
coverage. This could result in future product liability claims being 
uninsured. If there is a product liability judgment against us or a 
settlement 
agreement related to a product liability claim, our business, financial 
condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
We are dependent on a relatively limited number of retailer customers for a 
significant portion of our sales. 
We sell our products to retail partners and distributors in specialty 
channels. Our two largest retail partners, PetSmart and Petco, 
accounted for 58% and 20% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 
2012, 53% and 22% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 
2013, 49% and 24% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 
47% and 24% of our net sales for the three months ended March 
31, 2015, respectively. If we were to lose any of our key customers, if any 
of our retail partners reduce the amount of their orders or if any of our
