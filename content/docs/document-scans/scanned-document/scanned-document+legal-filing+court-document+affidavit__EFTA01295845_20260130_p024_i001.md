2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93633, * 
747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir. 1984) [hereinafter Poulis]. In Poulis, the Third Circuit stated that 
a district court [*4] must balance the following factors: 
1) the extent of the partys personal responsibility (2) the prejudice to the adversary caused by the failure to meet 
scheduling orders and respond to discovery. (3)a history of dilatoriness: (4) whether the conduct of the party or the 
attorney was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which ertails an analysis of 
alternative sanctions: and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim or defense. 
Id. (explaining that "dismissal is a drastic sanction and should be reserved for those cases 
where there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff')(alteration 
in original); see also In re E Toys Inc., 263 Fed. Appx. 235, 237 (3d Cir. 2008) (affirming 
the district court's dismissal of a bankruptcy appeal for failure to prosecute upon 
consideration of the Poulis factors). 
1 IFIN2j 'fin appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a barkruptcy judge to a district court or bankruptcy appellate panel ... 
shall be taken by Ming a notice of appeal with the clerk within the time allowed by Rule 8002. An appellant's failure to take any 
step other than timely filing a nonce of appeal [•6j does not affect the validity of the appeal. but is grand only for such action 
as the district court a bankruptcy appellate panel deems appropriate. which may include dismissal of the appeal... ." FED. R. 
BANKR. P. 8001(a) (2011). 
[HN3] "Not all of the[] Poulis factors need be met for a district court to find dismissal is 
warranted." Hicks v. Feeney, 850 F.2d 152, 156 (3d Cir. 1988). However, courts must 
consider and balance all six Poulis factors before dismissing a case with prejudice, and all 
doubts must be resolved in favor of an adjudication on the merits. See $8,221,877.16 in 
U.S. Currency, 330 F.3d 141, 161 (3d Cir. 2003) ("[W]e have always required 
consideration and balancing of all six of the factors, and have recommended the resolution 
of any doubts in favor of adjudication on the merits."); see also Bjorgung, 197 Fed. Appx. 
at 125-26 ("Although '[n]ot all of the Poulis factors need be satisfied in order to dismiss a 
complaint' they must all be considered") (quoting Mindek v. Rigatti, 964 F.2d 1369, 1373 
(3d Cir. 1992)). 
III. ANALYSIS 
In In re Richardson Industrial Contractors, Inc., 189 Fed. Appx. 93 (3d Cir. 2006), the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit addressed [*6] the relevant factors 
that a district court must consider before dismissing a bankruptcy appeal for failure to 
prosecute. In that case, the district court dismissed a creditors appeal with prejudice for 
failure to comply with the mandates of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. In so 
doing, the district court considered only two of the six Pocks factors: the creditor's bad faith 
in requesting a second extension of time in which to file his brief and the ineffectiveness of 
alternative sanctions. The creditor appealed the district court's decision. 
On appeal, the Third Circuit found that, in addition to not considering all six Pouts factors, 
the district court's discussion of two factors was limited and did not set out the basis for its 
conclusions in such a way to permit meaningful review of its decision. 
In reviewing similar cases in other circuits, the Richardson court noted that [HN4] " 
'[d]ismissal typically occurs in cases showing consistently dilatory conduct or the complete 
failure to take any steps other than the mere filing of a notice of appeal.' " Richardson, 189
