Nothing in this Section 6(f) will be effective to create a charge or other security interest. This Section 6(f) will be 
without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, offset, combination of accounts, lien, right of retention or

Transfer 
Subject to Section 6(b)(ii) and to the extent permitted by applicable law, neither this Agreement nor any interest or 
obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party 
without the prior written consent of the other party, except that:—

a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or 
merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any 
other right or remedy under this Agreement); and

Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will be made in the relevant 
currency specified in this Agreement for that payment (the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by 
applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency will not be 
discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such 
tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in good faith and using 
commercially reasonable procedures in convening the currency so tendered into the Contractual Currency, of the full 
amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement If for any reason the 
amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in 
respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, 
immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the 
shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual 
Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of 
such excess. 
(b) 
Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order expressed in a currency

Agreement. (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this Agreement or (iii) in 
respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in clause (i) or (ii) above. 
the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled pursuant to 
the judgment or order. will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the 
Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund 
promptly to the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such parry as a consequence of sums 
paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of 
exchange at which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purpose 
of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in good faith and using
