Additional Disclosures Regarding Certain Risk Factors 
The risks associated with investing in a private equity fund generally 
include: 
• Limited Regulatory Oversight - Since private equity funds are typically 
private investments, they do not face the same oversight and scrutiny from 
financial regulatory entities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission 
("SEC") and are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as 
regulated investment companies, (i.e., open-end or closed-end mutual funds) 
including requirements for such entities to provide certain periodic 
pricing and valuation information to investors. Private equity offering 
documents are not reviewed or approved by the SEC or any US state 
securities administrator or any other regulatory body. Also, managers may 
not be required by law or regulation to supply investors with their 
portfolio holdings, pricing, or valuation information. 
• Portfolio Concentration; Volatility - Many private equity funds may have a 
more concentrated or less diversified portfolio than an average mutual 
fund. While a more concentrated portfolio can have good results when a 
manager is correct, it can also cause a portfolio to have higher volatility. 
• Strategy Risk - Many private equity funds employ a single investment 
strategy. Thus, a private equity fund may be subject to strategy risk, 
associated with the failure or deterioration ofan entire strategy. 
• Use of Leverage and Other Speculative Investment Practices - Since many 
private equity fund managers use leverage and speculative investment 
strategies such as options, investors should be aware of the potential 
risks. When used prudently and for the purpose of risk reduction, these 
instruments can add value to a portfolio. However, when leverage is used 
excessively and the market goes down, a portfolio can suffer 
tremendously. When options are used to speculate (i.e., buy calls, short 
puts), a portfolio's returns can suffer and the risk of the portfolio can 
increase. 
• Valuations — Further there have been a number ofhigh profile instances 
where private equity fund managers have mispriced portfolios, either as an 
act of fraud or negligence. 
• Performance - Past performance is not necessarily indicative and is not a 
guarantee of a private equity fund's future results or performance. Some 
private equity funds may have little or no operating history or performance 
and may use hypothetical or pro forma performance that may not reflect 
actual trading done by the manager or advisor and should be reviewed 
carefully. Investors should not place undue reliance on hypothetical or pro 
forma performance. 
• Limited Liquidity - Investors in private equity funds have limited rights 
to transfer their investments. In addition, since private equity funds are 
not 
listed on any exchange, it is not expected that there will be a secondary 
market for them. Repurchases may be available, but only on a limited 
basis. A private equity fund's manager may deny a request to transfer if it 
determines that the transfer may result in adverse legal or tax 
consequences for the private equity fund. 
• Tax Risks — Investors in certain jurisdictions and in private equity funds 
generally may be subject to pass-through tax treatment on their investment.
