HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
financial institutions. Financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, 
Securities firms and exchanges with which an Underlying Fund interacts, as well as the Underlying 
Funds, are all subject to systemic risk. 
A systemic failure could have material adverse 
consequences on the Partnership and on the markets for the Securities in which an Underlying 
Fund seeks to invest. 
Execution of Orders 
An Underlying Fund's investment strategies and trading strategies depend on its ability to 
establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments 
selected by the Management Company. An Underlying Fund's trading orders may not be executed 
in a timely and efficient manner due to various circumstances, including, without limitation, 
trading volume surges or systems failures attributable to the Underlying Fund, the Management 
Company, the Underlying Fund's counterparties, brokers, dealers, agents or other service 
providers. In such event, the Underlying Fund might only be able to acquire or dispose of some, 
but not all, of the components of such position, or if the overall position were to need adjustment, 
the Underlying Fund might not be able to make such adjustment. As a result, an Underlying Fund 
would not be able to achieve the market position selected by the Management Company, which 
may result in a loss. In addition, the Underlying Funds rely heavily on electronic execution 
systems (and may rely on new systems and technology in the future), and such systems may be 
subject to certain systemic limitations or mistakes (e.g., "fat-finger" errors such as placing an order 
for 10,000,000 shares instead of 1,000,000), causing the interruption of trading orders made by an 
Underlying Fund or the Underlying Fund being exposed to significantly greater risk than 
anticipated. 
Cybersecurity Risk 
As part of its business, the Management Company processes, stores and transmits large 
amounts of electronic information, including information relating to the transactions of the 
Underlying Funds and personally identifiable information of the Limited Partners. Similarly, 
service providers of the Management Company, the Partnership or the Underlying Funds, 
especially the Administrator, may process, store and transmit such information. The Management 
Company has procedures and systems in place that it believes are reasonably designed to protect 
such information and prevent data loss and security breaches. However, such measures cannot 
provide absolute security. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data, disable or 
degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long 
periods of time. Hardware or software acquired from third parties may contain defects in design 
or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. 
Network connected services provided by third parties to the Management Company may be 
susceptible to compromise, leading to a breach of the Management Company's network. The 
Management Company's systems or facilities may be susceptible to employee error or 
malfeasance, government surveillance, or other security threats. On-line services provided by the 
Management Company to the Limited Partners may also be susceptible to compromise. Breach 
of the Management Company's information systems may cause information relating to the 
transactions of the Underlying Funds and personally identifiable information of the Limited 
Partners to be lost or improperly accessed, used or disclosed.
