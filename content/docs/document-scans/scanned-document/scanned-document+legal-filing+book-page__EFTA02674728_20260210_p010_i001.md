CORTEX 4 g (2013) 200-210 
We found that cortical space allocation on the mesial 
aspect appears to be characterized by a more extensive 
representation of the orbital and mesial frontal and cingulate 
cortices in the left than right hemisphere. 
4.4. 
Sex-linked differences 
Functional lateralization of the brain is present both in 
females and in males and is controlled by multiple factors (Liu 
et al., 2009). Examination of sex-linked differences in cortical 
morphology was not the primary focus of this study and any 
such differences reported here should be viewed as prelimi-
nary and requiring confirmation with larger samples. None-
theless, our findings suggest volumetric asymmetry in the 
cingulate cortex (left larger than right) in males but not in 
females. The functional implications of this asymmetry is 
unclear, but it does parallel the sex-linked differences in the 
effects of lateralized prefrontal lesions on response selection 
in an intentionally underconstrained, ambiguous perceptual 
preference tasks devoid of intrinsic "true-false" metric 
(Goldberg et al., 1994a, 1994b; Goldberg and Podell, 1999). In 
right-handed females, both left and right frontal lesions shift 
responses toward extreme dependence on the perceptual 
context, making them excessively changeable compared to 
healthy controls. In right-handed males right frontal lesions 
shift responses toward extreme context dependence, but left 
frontal lesions — toward extreme context independence 
characterized by excessively stable responses. 
These sex-linked differences in the lateralized prefrontal 
lesion effects on response selection parallel our findings of 
sex-linked differences in the relative sizes of the left and right 
ACC: they are symmetric in females and asymmetric in males. 
ACC plays a role in resolving situations characterized by 
uncertainty and ambiguity (Krain et al., 2006; Pushkarskaya 
et al., 2010). Sex-linked differences in the degree of laterali-
zation of the frontal-lobe control over response selection in 
ambiguous, underdetermined situations may be a conse-
quence of sex-linked differences in the degree of structural 
ACC asymmetries. While ACC is not the only structure 
implicated in decision making under ambiguity — so are the 
orbitofrontal and mesial frontal areas — the fact that the sex-
linked differences in decision making in ambiguous environ-
ments parallel the anatomical findings in ACC but not in the 
other regions may suggest a particularly central role of ACC in 
resolving ambiguity. 
4.5. 
Limitations and future directions 
Replication of our findings, particularly as they pertain to sex-
linked differences, needs to be conducted with a larger 
sample. The generalizability of our findings across lifespan is 
unclear at this time, since changes in morphological hemi-
spheric asymmetries with age have been reported (Raz et al., 
2004; Shaw et al., 2009). Thus replications in different age 
groups are important. 
Further elucidation of the relationship of hemispheric 
asymmetries described here and neurological/neuropsychi-
atric disorders is another promising direction. Several neuro-
logical and neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by 
asymmetric regional structural or physiological abnormalities, 
notably schizophrenia (Chance et al., 2008; Schobel et al., 2009; 
Wolf et al., 2008) and fronto-temporal dementia (Boccardi et al.. 
2003; )eong et al.. 2005; Kanda et al., 2008; Whitwell et al., 2005). 
The findings presented in this paper may help shed further 
light on the nature and implications of such asymmetries in 
these disorders. 
Several patterns of hemispheric asymmetries described in 
this paper are particularly intriguing. These include the dual 
asymmetry of lateral versus mesial heteromodal association 
cortices, and the asymmetry of cortical space allocation 
between heteromodal association and modality specific 
association cortices on the lateral (convexital) aspects of the 
two hemispheres. In this paper we presented morphometric 
findings without any correlated neuropsychological data. 
Future studies may attempt to correlate the degree of 
expression of the asymmetries described here in healthy 
individuals with cognitive variables. 
Analytic or computational models may also be illumi-
nating in understanding complex structure—function rela-
tions. The differences in cortical space allocation to 
heteromodal versus modality-specific cortices can be rela-
tively readily represented in formal models. It may be possible 
to clarify the functional ramifications of the asymmetries in 
cortical space allocation described in this paper computa-
tionally, by modeling them in multilayered neural net archi-
tectures and examining the effects of parametric variations 
within the models on teaming (for a more detailed outline of 
this approach see Goldberg, 2009). 
In conclusion, despite the prodigious body of work on 
hemispheric specialization, the riddle is far from solved, and 
more interdisciplinary work is needed, combining neuro-
psychological, neuroimaging, computational, genetic, and 
clinical approaches into a coordinated research effort.
