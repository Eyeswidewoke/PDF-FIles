Child 
There clearly can be a conflict between the law and society when it comes to 
defining a child. Sympathy for victims is inversely proportional to their age and 
sexual development. Many people using the term sexual abuse of children have 
a mental image of children 12 or younger. The main problem, therefore, is with 
the 13- to 17-year-old age group. Those are the child victims who most likely 
look, act, and have sex drives like adults, but who may or may not be considered 
children under some laws and by society. Pubescent teenagers can be viable sexual 
targets of a much larger population of sex offenders.. Unlike one-on-one 
intrafamilial sexual abuse in which the victim is most often a young female, in 
many sexual-exploitation cases the victim is a boy between the ages of 10 and 16. 
Under federal law a sexually explicit photograph of a 
mature-looking, 16-year-old girl or boy is legally child 
pornography. Such photographs are not, however, what 
most people think of when they think of child por-
nography. This again reflects the problem of definitions. 
Arguments about child pornography, such as whether it is 
openly sold or of interest only to pedophiles, may be primar-
ily the result of confusion over its definitions. 
Adolescents are frequently considered and counted by child advocates as 
children in order to emphasize the large scope of the child-victimization prob-
lem. But then little or nothing said or done about addressing the problem seems 
to apply to the reality of adolescent victims. If adolescents are considered child 
victims of sexual exploitation, then their needs, interests, and desires must be 
realistically recognized and understood when addressing the problem. 
Legal definitions of who is considered a child or minor vary from state-to-
state and even statute-to-statute when dealing with adolescent victims. During a 
prosecution the definition can even vary from count-to-count in the same indict-
ment. The age of the child may determine whether certain sexual activity is a 
misdemeanor or felony and what degree felony. Issues such as whether the victim 
consented or whether the offender was a guardian or caretaker can have impor-
tant legal significance. Sixteen year olds may be able to consent to have sex with 
the man down the street, but not with their father or schoolteacher. It is unclear 
to me how the law evaluates consent when dealing with a 14-year-old boy 
seduced by a 55-year-old adult. The easiest way for an adult to have sex with a 
child and come under no legal scrutiny is to marry the child. The age and circum-
stances under which a child can marry an adult also vary from state-to-state. 
To determine who is a child, investigators and prosecutors must again turn to 
the law. The penal code will legally define who is a child or minor. But they must 
still deal with their own perceptions as well as those of the jury and society as a 
whole. In general a child will be defined here as someone who has not yet reached 
his or her eighteenth birthday. One of the problems in using this broad, but sen-
timentally appealing, definition of a child is that it lumps together individuals 
who may be more unlike than alike. In fact 16 year olds may be socially and 
physically more like 26-year-old young adults than 6-year-old children. 
Sympathy for 
victims is inversely 
proportional tb their age 
and sexual development.
