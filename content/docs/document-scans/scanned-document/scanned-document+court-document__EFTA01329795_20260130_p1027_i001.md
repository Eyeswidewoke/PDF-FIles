Aitcraft, the Aircraft or any part thereof (including, without limitation, any warranty of the manufacturer of 
the Aircraft or any component or Flight Options), or in any way relating to or arising out of the 
manufacture, inspection, construction, purchase, pooling, interchange, acceptance, rejection, ownership, 
titling or re-titling, delivery, lease, sublease, possession, use, operation, maintenance, management, 
condition, registration or re-registration, sale, return, removal, repossession, storage or other disposition 
of any undivided interest in the Aircraft, the Aircraft or part thereof or any accident in connection therewith 
(including, without limitation, latent and other defects, whether or not discoverable, and any Claim for 
patent, trademark or copyright infringement). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Debtor shall not be required to indemnify RACC for (a) any Claim caused 
solely and directly by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the RACC or (b) any Claim in respect 
of the Aircraft arising from acts or events which occur after any and all other obligations of any kind 
whatsoever of Debtor hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents have been luny paid and/or 
performed, as the case may be, unless any such Claims were caused by Debtor (or any stockholder, 
director, officer, employee, successor, assignee, agent or servant of Debtor) or resulted or arose, directly 
or indirectly, from any acts, events or omissions of any kind whatsoever during the term hereof. 
The liability of Debtor to make indemnification payments shall, notwithstanding any expiration or other 
termination (whether voluntary, as the result of an Event of Default, or otherwise) hereof or any of the 
other Transaction Documents, continue to exist until such indemnity payments are irrevocably made in 
full by Debtor and received by RACC. If any Claim is made against Debtor or RACC, the party receiving 
notice of such Claim shall promptly notify the other, but the failure of the party receiving notice to so notify 
the other shall not relieve Debtor of any obligation hereunder. 
10. Event of Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, 
subject to the terms of the Operative Agreements, (a) RACC shall have the right to exercise (i) RACC's 
option to sell Debtor's interest in the Aircraft pursuant to Section 6.2.3 of the Aircraft Interest Purchase 
Agreement and shall be entitled to apply to the outstanding Obligations all amounts payable to Debtor in 
connection with such option exercise and/or (ii) all remedies allowed by law, including, without limitation, 
those available to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code and (b) to the extent practicable 
given the nature of the Collateral, RACC may require Debtor to assemble the Collateral and make it 
available to RACC at a place to be designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to both parties. 
The requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification to Debtor of the 
time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or 
other intended disposition is to be made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's 
address, as shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or disposition. After 
deduction of all reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and 
the like, together with reasonable costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and 
after the payment of the principal and interest due under the Promissory Note, the balance, if any, of the 
proceeds of the sale may be applied to the payment of any or all other Obligations, and to the satisfaction 
of Indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the Collateral of which RACC has received 
notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for any deficiency after application of 
such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law. After the occurrence of an Event of Default, Debtor agrees 
that, RACC may fly or otherwise move the Aircraft for demonstration and other purposes reasonably 
related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of the Collateral. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, RACC may at its option and in its sole discretion keep idle, lease, or use or operate all or part 
of Debtors undivided interest In the Aircraft without any liability whatsoever. To the extent permitted by 
applicable law, Debtor hereby waives any rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise which 
may require RACC to sell, lease or otherwise use Debtor's undivided interest in the Aircraft, and/or the 
Aircraft In mitigation of RACC's damages as set forth in this Section or otherwise provided herein or which 
may otherwise limit or modify any of RACC's rights or remedies under this Section or otherwise provided 
herein. 
11. Sale of Aircraft and/or Related Collateral. In the event the Aircraft and/or related Collateral Is 
sold, RACC may declare all Obligations Immediately due and payable.
