securities laws and that determination may also have an adverse effect on 
the market prices of the Notes. 
Investment Company Act. The Issuer does not intend to register as an 
investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended, in reliance on the exception provided in Section 3(c)(7) of said 
act. If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to determine that 
the Issuer is required to so register, the Issuer could be subject to an 
enforcement action, the assessment of damages and other negative 
consequences and an Event of Default will occur under the Offering Circular. 
Tax Considerations. Special tax considerations may apply to certain types 
of taxpayers and prospective investors should consider the potential impact 
that proposed tax legislation (the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 
("FATCA") provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment ("HIRE") 
Act) could have on the Issuer and an investment in the Notes. In 
particular, legislation recently proposed in the United States Congress 
introduces a complex set of new reporting and withholding rules that could 
affect the reporting obligations of the Issuer and potentially cause the 
Issuer to be subject to a non-refundable 30% withholding tax on US source 
fixed or determinable annual or periodic ("FDAP") income. 
Prospective 
investors are urged to consult with their own tax advisors to determine any 
tax implications of this investment. 
ERISA. The Notes are subject to certain restrictions on their acquisition, 
holding and disposition for the purposes of Title I of the United States 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), 
Section 4975 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 
(the "Code") and other federal, state, local or non- U.S. laws substantially 
similar to those provisions. Investment in ERISA restricted Notes by 
employee benefit plans, subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and by 
entities holding assets of such plans will be limited to less than 25% of 
such Note. Each purchaser and each subsequent transferee of the ERISA 
restricted Notes will be required to make certain representations as to 
whether it is such employee benefit plan or entity and transfers of such 
Notes will be subject to the foregoing limitation. Purchasers and 
subsequent transferees of all of the Notes will be required to represent 
that their acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes will not 
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA, 
Section 4975 of the Code, or any similar law. 
Risk Factors 
The following is not an exhaustive list of all the risks associated with an 
investment in the transaction. Investors should carefully review the final 
transaction documentation relating to the Notes, including the description 
of risk factors contained therein, prior to making a decision to invest in 
the Notes. The information set forth in this term sheet will be superseded 
in its entirety by any subsequent versions of this information and by the 
final Offering Circular relating to the Notes. This summary does not take 
into account an investor's particular situation, liquidity needs, tax 
status, existing holdings or leverage, all of which should be considered in 
making an investment decision.
