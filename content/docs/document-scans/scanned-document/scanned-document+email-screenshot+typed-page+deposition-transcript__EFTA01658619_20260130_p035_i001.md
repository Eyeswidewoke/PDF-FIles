The New York Times (9/22, Castle, 18.61M) reports British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on 
Tuesday "announced plans to impose new restrictions on nightlife, including the forced early 
closure of pubs and restaurants in England, as he ramps up efforts to curb a rising tide of 
coronavirus infections." Johnson "also announced on Tuesday that the government was 
encouraging people to work from home if they can, reversing course from an earlier effort to 
push workers in Britain to return to their offices." 
The Washington Post (9/22, Adam, 14.2M) reports that "face masks will be mandatory for 
retail workers, taxi drivers, and bar and restaurant staff, as well as customers when they are 
not seated at a table, the prime minister said." The Post observes that the new measures were 
"more modest than many that reportedly had been under discussion, including a two-week 
mini-lockdown." 
The AP (9/22) reports Johnson "also said stiff fines will be imposed on anyone breaking 
quarantine rules or gathering in groups of more than six." The Prime Minister "said the change 
of tack was necessary in light of a recent uptick in cases and implored people to follow the new 
rules to avert a further total lockdown." 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (9/22, story 8, 1:30, O'Donnell, 4.31M) said "the Prime Minister 
told the country the restrictions could last for six months. ... Schools will stay open for now, but 
the Prime Minister did not rule out another lockdown if the numbers don't improve." 
Britain's hospitality industry, Bloomberg (9/22, Seal, 4.73M) reports, is warning that the 
new measures risk "widespread failures and deeper job losses without more government help." 
Experts Warn Restriction Fatigue Fueling Increase In Cases In Europe. 
The Wall Street Journal (9/22, Sylvers, Stancati, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that 
the number of COVID-19 infections in Europe is increasing in part because many people 
become tired of social distancing rules, mask-wearing and hand-sanitizing, according to health 
experts, who say that the desire to return to normalcy and public fatigue for such policies are 
the biggest challenges facing governments. 
Peace Talks Eyed As Path To End Fighting In Somalia. 
The Washington Times (9/22, Wolfgang, 492K) reports, "Unprecedented diplomacy gave the 
Trump administration a path out of Afghanistan, and questions have been raised about whether 
a similar playbook could work for the seemingly endless US military mission in Somalia." 
According to the Times, "debate is growing in foreign policy circles about whether the US should 
shift its focus to negotiations rather than a war with no end date and murky metrics for 
progress" in its campaign against Al-Shabab. The question is said to have "grown more urgent 
with serious setbacks in recent years for al Qaeda and the Islamic State group," but it is 
"unclear whether the administration has seriously considered putting its own diplomatic weight 
behind negotiations with al-Shabab in the same way it did with the Taliban." 
Pompeo Predicts "Excellent Cooperation" From Europe On Iran Arms Embargo. 
In an interview with the Washington Examiner (9/22, Gehrke, 448K), Secretary of State 
Pompeo predicted "European intelligence agencies will partner with the United States to enforce 
an arms embargo on Iran...despite disputes within the alliance about the legal basis for that 
ban." Said Pompeo, "We think the network will cooperate. We think there is a shared 
understanding about the risk from the Islamic Republic of Iran." Addressing European 
objections to US efforts to reimpose UN sanctions, Pompeo said, "The Europeans have taken 
truly a middle position on this. That is, 'We like the outcome; we don't like the process,' and 
they'll adhere to the provisions of the outcome."
