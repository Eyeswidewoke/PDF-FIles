postnote May 2008 Number 308 Alternatives to custodial sentencing Page 
requirements it contains. The NA0 has recommended 
that the Ministry of Justice should determine the full cost 
of implementing different types of community orders.' 2
Second, there is the value that community sentences add 
to communities. For instance, in 2007, more than 6 
million hours of compulsory unpaid work were carried out 
in communities in England and Wales by offenders who 
received a community order. This is estimated to have 
benefited communities by around £33 million. 
Availability of requirements 
In its report on the supervision of community orders in 
England and Wales'', the NAO concluded that some 
community order requirements are not available, or are 
rarely used, in some areas. In particular, it noted that 
there were long waiting lists for some requirements, such 
as group programmes dealing with domestic violence. A 
recent survey by the National Association of Probation 
Officers also highlighted problems with availability of 
treatment courses used as part of community penalties." 
The NAO has recommended that the Ministry of Justice 
work with the Department of Health and other agencies 
to increase the provision of mental health and alcohol 
treatments across all areas. 
Completion of community orders 
Data on the completion of order requirements are not 
routinely compiled. A case file review conducted by the 
NA0 suggested that around 6% of offenders were unable 
to complete an order requirement before their order 
ended. The NA0 recommended that the Ministry of 
Justice should require all Probation Areas to report the 
percentage of community orders which end before 
sentence requirements are completed along with the 
reasons for the non-completion. Reasons might include 
a breach of the order by the offender, revocation of an 
order by a court or lack of probation capacity to deliver 
the requirement. 
Public perception 
There is some evidence to suggest that the public may 
perceive community sentences as being too lenient. The 
Lord Chief Justice contrasted such perceptions with the 
realities of the criminal justice system in a speech in May 
2006.79 He stressed that community sentences were not 
used for offenders committing serious crimes or those 
who pose a threat to society. Furthermore, he noted that 
community sentences provide a visible demonstration of 
reparation to the community in which the offence took 
place and that the community is able to influence and to 
understand the nature and type of sentence performed. 
Research issues 
The relationship between type of sentence and re-
offending rates is complex. There is a need for further 
research on the impact and effectiveness of alternatives 
to prison, along with consideration of why, and under 
what circumstances, community sentences work. It has 
been argued that there has been an over-reliance on 
reconviction data and that reconviction needs to be 
considered in relation to other life-style or risk factors." 
There has also been a lack of rigorous evaluation of UK 
programmes, which means that much of the evidence 
base for UK policy comes from evaluations of North 
American interventions. 
Young adult offenders 
Young men make up a significant proportion of the 
prisoner population; a quarter of all sentenced and un-
sentenced receptions to prison are under twenty-one 
years of age. However, 18-21 year-old prisoners have 
been described as "a lost generation"" in terms of policy 
focus. While recent initiatives and policy developments 
such as the Youth Justice Board, Surestart, Child Trust 
Funds, Connexions, and Youth Offending Teams target 
the under 18s, resources are less readily available to 
young people who have passed their 1r birthday. 
The wider perspective 
This note has focused on the effectiveness of the main 
alternatives to custody for young people. However, there 
is a wider range of issues associated with housing, 
poverty, and education that are beyond the scope of this 
note, but that are important factors in any consideration 
of the reduction of offending by young people.
