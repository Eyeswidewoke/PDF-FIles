Table of Contents 
Fogo de Chao, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
(in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
post-combination services, and compensation expense related to the exchange 
was allocated by the Company based on the proportion of the 
completed service period of each award at the time of the exchange. As of 
January 1, 2012, Predecessor had recognized $1,114 of share-based 
compensation expense related to these awards. Accordingly, $1,159 was 
recognized by Predecessor related to the settlement of these awards, 
including the portion of taxes paid to relevant tax authorities on behalf of 
the holders, representing payment for pre-combination services on 
July 20, 2012. In addition, the Successor recorded expense of $2,223 
immediately in the Successor period, related to taxes paid on the SAR 
holders' behalf that were attributed to post-combination services, for which 
no future service period is required. The remaining fair value of $3,495 
attributed to these awards is being recognized prospectively by Successor 
over their respective graded vesting terms of between four and five years. 
During the period from May 24, 2012 through December 30, 2012 (successor 
period), the Company recognized $641 related to these awards. 
The aggregate amount of the settlement of SARs attributable to pre-
combination services was $8,722 and was recorded as part of 
consideration transferred in connection with the 2012 Acquisition. The 
portion of the SARs settlement related to pre-combination services included 
$1,395 of non-cash consideration related to the exchange of SARs for 
restricted stock. 
The Company will receive no future tax benefit related to the post-
combination compensation charges noted above. 
There were no SARs outstanding as of December 28, 2014 or December 29, 2013. 
2012 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (Successor) 
In connection with the 2012 Acquisition, the Company established the 2012 
Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan"). The 2012 Plan 
provides for the Company to sell or issue restricted common stock or to 
grant stock options, stock appreciation rights or other share-based awards 
to employees, members of the board of directors and consultants of the 
Company. The 2012 Plan is administered by the board of directors, or at the 
discretion of the board of directors, by a committee of the board. The 
exercise prices, vesting and other restrictions are determined at the 
discretion 
of the board of directors, or their committee, if so delegated, except that 
the exercise price per share of stock options may not be less than 100% of 
the fair market value of the share of common stock on the date of grant and 
the term of the stock option may not be greater than ten years (the 
maximum allowed contractual life). 
Under the 2012 Plan, a maximum of 90,000 shares of common stock are reserved 
for issuance of stock-based awards, and a maximum of 
25,149 shares of restricted stock only to be issued in connection with the 
2012 Acquisition. The Company issued the maximum allowed number of 
shares of restricted stock to employees of the Company in connection with 
the settlement of SARs in connection with the 2012 Acquisition.
