diversified shareholders would prefer their firms to be more risk-preferring. Older, infirm, or 
impatient shareholders want short-term profits, while younger, healthier or more patient 
shareholders want to wait on steady growth. Preferred stockholders prefer certain-short 
term gains but common stockholders prefer riskier long-term strategies. Some 
shareholders want profits without regard to ethical consequences, other investors are 
willing to ease up on the profit throttle if it means doing less harm to others. Proponents of 
shareholder primacy in firm governance have not considered the inevitable conflicts in 
simultaneous commitments to these different groups of shareholders to be an 
insurmountable problem. Instead, the inevitability of conflicts between different groups of 
shareholders is advanced as one of the key reasons why corporations must be run by an 
independent, authoritative board of directors which can manage such conflicts in a way 
that best serves the interests of all competing parties. "• Directors presently do this with 
almost no guidance from courts or statutory law as to whose interests are to be privileged 
in what circumstances when conflicts inevitably arise. The confidence that corporate law 
already evinces in directors' ability to overcome the two-masters problem across different 
groups of shareholders should also serve to assuage doubts that directors can effectively 
manage conflicts across different groups of stakeholders. r217] 
Nevertheless, the reality of conflicts between different stakeholders should be reflected 
in the discursive practices of multi-stakeholder corporate governance. Directorial speech 
about stakeholders need not always be concerned with maximizing trust. Indeed, once 
trust has been established in a relationship, our motive for coherence and the threat of 
dissonance sometimes keeps us trusting too much, which can leave us vulnerable to 
manipulation. "s We tend in our explanations of our behavior (to ourselves and others) to 
minimize the inconsistency in competing obligations in order to reduce the cognitive 
dissonance we would otherwise suffer. 
As Claire Hill and Erin Ann O'Hara recently 
pointed out, social policy should be concerned not with "maximizing" trust, but with 
optimizing it. a" The discursive goal of corporate speech must then be clarity and honesty, 
rather than necessarily trust-inducing in every case. Directors should be encouraged to 
recognize conflicts between stakeholders and to communicate openly and honestly about 
them. 
B. Prescriptive Discourse Norms 
Corporate law scholarship must help boards of directors to develop effective ways of 
engaging in multi-stakeholder discourse. In this section I briefly examine two different 
"prescriptive" discourse norms authored by two leading scholars for use in other areas, but 
which I think might usefully be deployed to help develop a new default discourse norm for 
use in multi-stakeholder corporate governance. 
1. Expressive Overdetermination in Firm Governance 
Earlier, I reviewed Dan Kahan's critique of the norm of public reason, and showed the 
ways in which his critique is relevant to the problems of corporate political speech. a's 
Kahan follows his critique with the offer of an alternative discourse norm that he argues is 
psychologically realistic and more instrumentally promising than the norm of public reason. 
He urges the adoption of "expressive overdetermination"-a norm with a somewhat 
cumbersome name, but one which is nevertheless well worth considering. Expressive 
overdetermination has two basic elements. First, it requires political speakers to recognize
