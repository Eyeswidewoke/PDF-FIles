HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
These programs or systems may be subject to certain limitations, including, but not limited to, 
those caused by incorrect code, computer "worms," viruses and power failures. The Underlying 
Funds' operations are highly dependent on each of these systems and the successful operation of 
such systems is often out of the Underlying Funds' or the Management Company's control. The 
failure of one or more systems or the inability of such systems to satisfy the Underlying Funds' 
new or growing businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Underlying Funds. For 
example, systems failures could cause settlement of trades to fail, lead to inaccurate accounting, 
recording or processing of trades or regulatory reporting, and cause inaccurate reports, which may 
affect the ability of the Partnership to monitor the investment portfolios and risks of the Underlying 
Funds. 
The General Partner and the Administrator will provide to the Limited Partners statements, 
reports and other communications related to the Partnership in electronic form, such as email or 
via a password protected website ("Electronic Communications"). Electronic Communications 
may be modified, corrupted or contain viruses or malicious code and may not be compatible with 
a Limited Partner's electronic system. In addition, reliance on Electronic Communications 
involves the risk of inaccessibility, power outages or slowdowns. These periods of inaccessibility 
may delay or present receipt of reports or other information by the Limited Partners. 
Importance of Market Judgment 
Although the Management Company may use quantitative valuation models in evaluating 
the economic components of certain prospective trades, most of the Management Company's 
strategies are generally not systematic; the market judgment and discretion of the Management 
Company's personnel are fundamental to the implementation of these strategies. The greater the 
importance of subjective factors, the more unpredictable a trading strategy becomes. 
Exchange Rates 
An Underlying Fund may invest in Securities and instruments denominated in non-U.S. 
currencies. Such investments are subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will 
change in relation to the dollar. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade 
balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in 
different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political 
developments. The Management Company may seek (but is not required) to hedge these risks by 
investing directly in non-U.S. currencies and buying and selling options, futures or forward 
contracts thereon. The Partnership cannot, however, assure any Limited Partner that these 
strategies, if implemented, will be effective. 
Duration of Investment Positions 
The Management Company typically does not know (except in the case of certain options 
or derivatives positions which have pre-established expiration dates) the maximum—or, often, 
even the expected (as opposed to optimal)—duration of any particular position at the time of 
initiation. The length of time for which a position is maintained varies significantly, based on the 
Management Company's subjective judgment of the appropriate point at which to liquidate a 
position so as to augment gains or reduce losses.
