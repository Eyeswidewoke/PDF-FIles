Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
In May 2814, the FASB issued ASU No. 2814-09, "Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers." The core principle of the standard is that an 
entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or 
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
the 
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The 
ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. 
New qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements aim to enable 
financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and 
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. 
The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after 
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. 
We will be required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 
Fiscal 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The ASU permits the use of 
either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have 
not yet selected a transition method or determined the effect, if any, that 
this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related 
disclosures. 
In August 2814, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial 
Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure 
of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." 
ASU 2814-15 will require management to evaluate whether there are 
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability 
to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial 
statements are issued. The new standard is effective for the annual period 
ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim 
periods thereafter. We will be required to adopt this new standard Fiscal 
2016. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material 
impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-2, "Consolidation (Topic 
828): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis." ASU 2015-2 
provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in 
evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal 
entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation 
model. The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies 
the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities 
are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a 
general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies 
the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with 
VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-2 is 
effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal 
years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We will be required to adopt this 
new standard Fiscal 2016. We are currently in the process of 
evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this ASU will have on our 
consolidated financial statements. 
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of 
Debt Issuance Costs," which changes the presentation of debt 
issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to 
present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
