stock units, representing the right to receive, upon vesting and the expiration of any applicable restricted period, one share of Class A common 
stock for each restricted stock unit, or, in the sole discretion of the Committee, the cash value thereof (or any combination thereof). As to restricted 
shares of our Class A common stock, subject to the other provisions of our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the holder will generally have the rights 
and privileges of a stockholder as to such restricted shares of Class A common stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote such restricted 
shares of Class A common stock (except. that if the lapsing of restrictions with respect to such restricted shares of Class A common stock is

shares of Class A common stock will be retained, and delivered without interest to the holder of such shares within a specified period following the 
date on which the shares vest and any applicable restrictions lapse). Participants have no rights or privileges as a stockholder with respect to 
restricted stock units.
