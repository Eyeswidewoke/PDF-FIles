Leon, 
Yesterday , I agai= spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( =peak to brad to get flavor) and you and i 
will discuss the results in gory= gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing =he things that I 
don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspe=tive, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, =A0might be 
helpful. You and your family are a 6 bill=on dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per year..C2 
It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of =xisting investments, in various categories , a desire to enter into 
=thers. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range =f all types of taxes. , planes. boats homes.. trusts ,=rats. a 
crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight )=. law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns, foreign firms. art 
co=sultants. construction consultants bill payers, home mgmt.=vast multitude of Ilc's , including foreign, and =AO with 
all that you only have a combined overhead of less tha= 3 million dollars. 
I have previously se=t you the very same note that i have enclosed again belo= ,this time with highlights . I wrote it 
to you over a y=ar ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems=to have been raised as one of your concerns 
, as a=rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out=C2 issues that I fear may later turn out to be 
a problem. ie=C2 what i would and wouldn't do, - my responsibilities. etc =C2 and those things that are not. below you 
will find detail= of things that I thought needed to be done, so that yo= wouldn't find yourself in the very place 
where you curren=ly find yourself. however ,you chose to defer many of my sugge=tions- see below -,until only weeks 
ago. ! you chose to defer =the jpm acct. the art partnership on and on - into this year. an= though the 60- 50 40 timber 
emails all carried with it a clear warn=ng that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabil=ze,- you 
chose to wait. 
ONE YEAR AGO 
Feb 17 2014 i wr=te 
With =egard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed.=C2 I am torn, as my very strong 
inclination is not to be involved=at all . It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many=pitfall many that 
will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. =AO I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people 
involved ne=d to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way b=fore the beginning of my involvement ) I 
am also aware however =AO of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, =given all the complexities who else can 
do it? problem. 
=A0Your family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions ar= running around , sniping , nitpicking with little 
direction. As a s=opgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take c=arge Everyone would report t= him. 
Eileen included. He would however work for me. th=s is not, by a long shot my first choice as I prefer only bein= 
responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( i= the word DONE will no longer be transmitted to reflect 
status stated=C2 by others ) 
With no commitment on =y part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my att=mpt in trying to think through 
the problem creatively .=C2 My organizations handling of=the more complex issues I believe you might find very 
costly,=C2 very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, m=ybe risk caps ,etc ) but would req=ire my 
teams doing the work , not yours. Ada shou=d be only a trust, grat administrator. not sure what=role you prefer for 
Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee inv=stments. whether Rich your controller stays or not, is not urg=nt. having
