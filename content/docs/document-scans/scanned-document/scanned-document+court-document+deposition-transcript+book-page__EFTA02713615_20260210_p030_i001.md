through which homeowners can pay off their debt. In the U.S., homeowners have the right to 
prepay their mortgage at any point in time. The homeowner's right to prepay his mortgage 
through voluntary means (home sales, refinancing, curtailment) can be thought of as equivalent 
to the homeowner purchasing a "call option" when he enters into a mortgage contract. Similarly, 
the homeowner's right to default on his mortgage (involuntary prepayment) is equivalent to 
purchasing a "put option" when he enters into a mortgage contract. Thus, the investor in an 
MBS has a short position in a call and put option (usually referred to jointly as a prepayment 
option) and a long position in non-callable bond with the same payment schedule as the MBS 
(there are some special cases discussed below in which MBS holders can be long prepayment 
options). The implication is that the risks associated with investing in an MBS are a combination 
of the risks that are present in all fixed-income cash flows along with some risks that are specific 
to MBS. Many of the complexities of MBS valuation arise from the fact that the value of the 
prepayment option of the homeowner is a complex function of many variables including the 
actual path of interest rates, the average age of the mortgage pool, the borrower's credit profile, 
home price appreciation, and the slope of the yield curve, among other factors. 
Distressed Securities. The Partnership may trade in "distressed securities" -- securities, 
private claims and obligations of domestic and foreign entities which are experiencing significant 
financial or business difficulties, such as loans, commercial paper, loan participations, trade 
claims held by trade or other creditors, stocks, partnership interests and similar financial 
instruments, executory contracts and options or participations therein not publicly traded. 
Distressed securities involve a substantial degree of risk. The Partnership may lose a substantial 
portion or all of its investment in a distressed position or may be required to accept cash or 
securities with a value less than the Partnership's investment. Among the risks inherent in 
positions in entities experiencing significant financial or business difficulties is the fact that it 
frequently may be difficult to obtain information as to the true condition of such issuers. Such 
positions also may be adversely affected by state and federal laws relating to, among other 
things, fraudulent conveyances, voidable preferences, lender liability and the bankruptcy court's 
discretionary power to disallow, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims. The market 
prices of such positions are also subject to abrupt and erratic market movements and above 
average price volatility, and the spread between the bid and asked prices of such instruments may 
be greater than normally expected. In trading distressed securities, litigation is sometimes 
required. Such litigation can be time-consuming and expensive, and can frequently lead to 
unpredicted delays or losses. 
The Partnership may also trade in "distressed" sovereign debt obligations. There are 
particular risks relating to the investment and trading of these instruments. These risks include 
the uncertainties involved in enforcing and collecting debt obligations against sovereign nations. 
The ability to enforce and collect obligations against foreign sovereigns may be affected by 
world events, changes in U.S. foreign policy, and other factors outside the control of the 
Partnership. 
Illiquid Securities. 
The Partnership may also trade in illiquid securities, such as 
unregistered securities of publicly held companies and securities of privately held companies. 
Such positions may require a significant amount of time from the date of initial investment 
before disposition. At various times, the markets for securities purchased or sold by the 
Partnership may be "thin" or illiquid, making the purchase or sale of securities at desired prices
