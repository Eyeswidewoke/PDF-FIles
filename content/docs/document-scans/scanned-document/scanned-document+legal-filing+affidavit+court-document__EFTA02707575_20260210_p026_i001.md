$0.35 million ending on December 31, 2016. The loan is secured by the assets of all of the child care 
centers in the United Kingdom. The interest rate on the facility, as defined in the agreement, is the 
aggregate of a margin, London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and fees which was 5.51% at 
December 31, 2011. Interest payments shall be made on the last day of each interest period. The 
Company has entered into an interest rate swap on the additional HSBC facility in addition to the swaps 
held on the already existing HSBC facility and the previous RBS facility. These swaps fix the interest 
rate on two thirds of the loan at an effective rate of 5.51% through maturity. As the interest rate swap 
has not been designated as a hedge of specific underlying interest rate exposure, it has been marked to 
market with the resulting gains or losses recognized as a component of interest expense in the 
consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of the interest rate swap at December 31, 2011, was 
$1.7 million. The unrealized loss of $1.7 million has increased by S1.3 million in 2011 and this increase 
is included in interest expense for 2011. The swap converts $38.2 million of notional debt from floating 
rate to fixed rate of 5.55% and matures on January 29, 2016. The Company was in compliance with the 
covenants of the UK Bank loans as of December 31, 2011. 
Unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes — In February 2005, senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") 
in the amount of $260.0 million were issued to refinance certain indebtedness in connection with the 
acquisition of KinderCare Learning Centers. The Notes bear interest at 7.75%, payable semiannually on 
February 1 and August 1 of each year, and are due in February 2015. 
The Notes may be redeemed at any time, in whole or in part, after February 2011 at a redemption price 
equal to 102.58% of the principal amount of the Notes and declining yearly to par in February 2015, 
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. 
Upon the occurrence of a change of control, KUEH's subsidiary, KUE LLC, will be required to make an 
offer to repurchase all Notes properly tendered at a price equal to 101.0% of the principal amount plus 
accrued and unpaid interest through the date of repurchase. 
The indenture governing the Notes contains various nonfinancial covenants that limit KUE LLC's 
ability to, among other things, enter into agreements that restrict KUE LLC's subsidiaries from paying 
dividends or other distributions, making loans or otherwise transferring assets to KUE LLC or to any 
other subsidiaries, incurring additional debt or issuing preferred stock, establishing new liens on assets, 
making certain restricted payments and investments, selling assets or capital stock of subsidiaries in 
excess of established limits, engaging in certain transactions with affiliates, and making certain 
fundamental changes to the business. 
Loan from Affiliate — In January 2005, the Company borrowed $200 million from an affiliate in 
connection with the Company's acquisition of KinderCare. In December 2010, the Company repaid 
$100 million of this loan. In April 2011, the Company repaid the balance. 
Credit Agreement — In June 2010, KUEH's subsidiary, KUE LLC, entered into an amended and 
restated four-year credit agreement with a group of syndicated lenders (the "Credit Agreement"). The 
Credit Agreement consists of an $85.0 million revolving line of credit, with increased borrowing 
capacity available as additional lenders enter the facility, up to a total of $100.0 million. At KUE LLC's 
discretion, borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at the base rate plus 1.75% or the 
LIBOR plus 2.75%. The base rate is the higher of the lender's prime rate or 0.50% in excess of the 
federal funds effective Rate. In addition, the Credit Agreement allows for a maximum of $75.0 million 
for letters of credit against the current borrowing capacity of the revolving line of credit and up to 
$10.0 million for selected short-term borrowings. KUE• LLC pays fees on the outstanding balance of 
letters of credit at an annual rate of 2.75%, plus a fronting fee of 0.25%. KUE LLC is also required to 
pay fees of 0.63% on the unborrowed and uncommitted balances under the Credit Agreement.
