SRLP102 Alpha Group Capital 
Forward-Looking Information 
Any projections or other estimates included in the Confidential Information, including estimates 
of returns or performance, are forward-looking statements and are based upon certain assumptions. 
Other events which were not taken into account may occur and may significantly affect the actual 
returns or performance of the Skis Funds and/or any of the companies in which the Siris Funds or 
Sins Capital have invested or may invest. Any assumptions should not be construed to be 
indicative of the actual events which will occur. Actual events are difficult to project and depend 
upon factors that are beyond the control of the Sins Funds, Siris Capital and their respective 
affiliates, members, partners, stockholders, other beneficial owners, managers, directors, officers, 
employees, representatives or agents. Certain assumptions have been made to simplify the 
presentation and, accordingly, actual results may differ, perhaps materially, from those presented 
therein. 
Projections 
Past or projected performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, and there can be no 
assurance that the Skis Funds or their investments will achieve comparable results to those 
presented in the Confidential Information, that the Sins Funds will be able to implement their 
investment strategies or achieve their investment objectives or that the returns generated by any 
investments will equal or exceed any past or projected returns presented therein. Any estimated 
future returns set forth in the Confidential Information (the "Projection?) are hypothetical, have 
been prepared and are set out for illustrative purposes only, and do not constitute a forecast. They 
have been prepared based on Siris Capital's current view in relation to future events and various 
estimations and assumptions made by Sins Capital or the applicable investments, including 
estimations and assumptions about events that have not yet occurred. Such estimations and 
assumptions may require modification as additional information becomes available and as 
economic and market developments warrant. Any such modification could be either favorable or 
adverse. While the Projections are based on assumptions that Siris Capital believes are reasonable 
under the circumstances, they are subject to uncertainties, changes (including changes in 
economic, operational, political, legal, tax and other circumstances) and other risks, including, but 
not limited to, broad trends in business and finance, tax and other legislation affecting the Siris 
Funds, their investors, investments, monetary and fiscal policies, interest rates, inflation, market 
conditions, the level and volatility of trading markets, the availability and cost of short-term or 
long-term finding and capital, all of which are beyond Sins Capital's control and any of which 
may cause the relevant actual, financial and other results to be materially different from the results 
expressed or implied by such Projections. Industry experts may disagree with the estimations and 
assumptions used in preparing the Projections. 
No assurance, representation or warranty is made by any person that any of the Projections will be 
achieved, and no recipient of this Information should rely on the Projections. None of the Sins 
Funds, Sins Capital, their affiliates or any of the respective directors, officers, employees, partners, 
shareholders, advisers or agents of any of the foregoing makes any assurance, representation or 
warranty as to the accuracy of the Projections. Nothing contained therein may be relied upon as a 
guarantee, promise or forecast or a representation as to the future.
