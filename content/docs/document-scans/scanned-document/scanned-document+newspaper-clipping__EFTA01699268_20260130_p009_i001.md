TRAVEL 
Bloomberg Pursuits 
August 5,2019 
saying, 'This is who we are!" If they were trying to look scary, 
they succeeded with me, especially as the flotilla increased 
to dozens of canoes. 
Onshore, men performed a traditional ceremony to launch 
a new canoe. It was a frenzy of hip-swinging dancing, raised 
spears and shields, chanting, yelping, and drumming. Women 
in grass skirts, some topless, danced in support. Passengers 
stood on the edge of the ceremony, the action only some-
what diluted by some of the villagers holding cellphones. 
They were taking pictures of us, as we were of them. And 
what a sight we were in our "adventure" wear, sun hats, and 
sunglasses, slathered in sunscreen and bug spray. I hadn't 
thought of myself as a cultural attraction, but locking eyes 
with a half-naked elderly woman, I realized we both were 
probing another world. I felt oin of place in this one. 
Cruisers pulled out rupiah to purchase Asmat art, which 
is sought by museums and collectors around the world. 
(Rockefeller was seeking pieces for the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art's collection of primitive works when he disappeared.) 
The art traditionally tells the stories of ancestors, but when I 
picked up a figurine for about Us-some works went for quite 
a bit more—and asked about its symbolism, the shy artist said 
it was just something he imagined. 
Oswald Huma, a tour agent from the island of Savu, west 
of Timor, was hired by Coral Expeditions, based in Cairns, 
Australia, to help map out our "Warriors and Wildlife" itin-
erary. He said the most common question the villagers ask 
is, "Why do these people come to see us?" He struggles with 
the answer, usually replying that travelers want to buy the 
wood carvings. He doesn't want to mention the attraction of 
a history of headhunting. 
Robinson says the interactions bring much-needed income.

She's noticed that, since she first visited the Asmat a few years 
ago, conditions seem to have improved. "The way I see it, for 
these people who are miles away from any of the circuits of 
capital, tourism is helping them to realize that they do have 
something the world will buy, which is their culture," she says. 
"We might have anxieties about it. But all through Indonesia, 
people hope that tourism is going to bring income into these 
remote areas. These people are separate from the exigencies 
of the world. Pristine and untouched has also got its negatives!" 
The visits also provide the Asmat an opportunity to prac-
tice their culture, Huma says. Elders traditionally teach youth 
the group's customs by performing ceremonies; paying cus-
tomers are an excuse to do so. Kids also see the outside world 
and have an opportunity to practice English, "so they can go 
out and seek employment and send money home;' he says. 
"It's like anywhere where people are performing their cul-
ture," says Kirsch, the Michigan professor. "It can be uncom-
fortable, but it can also promote mutual recognition. The 
Asmat are well known for their art, and these encounters can 
stimulate appreciation for the artistic style!' 
Agats, a larger town we visited nearby, has imported goods 
for sale to locals. Among them are rice, which isn't a staple 
of the Asmat diet but has become popular, as well as electric 
motorbikes, tea, sugar, and cellphones. Given the spotty signal, 
the phones are mostly used as cameras and for playing music. 
Huma had spent months in his boat on the Arafura Sea 
south of West Papua, sometimes in rough seas, convincing 
leaders in remote villages to welcome the Coral Adventurer. 
He also arranged for English speakers to meet us at each of 
four stops. Many are teachers, and some traveled far for the 
jobs as guides.
