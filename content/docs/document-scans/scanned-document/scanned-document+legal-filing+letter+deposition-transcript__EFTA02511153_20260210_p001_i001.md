Leon, 
in order to keep things in perspective, =A0 and I recognize this is difficult, you have a 6 billion dollar co. with income 
between 250 -500 millino dollars pe= year. It contains operating biz investments.- loans not=s. , planes boats homes.. 
trusts grats. over 100 bank accts.. law firms, acct firms, foreign firms. art consultants. contruction consultatnst =ill 
payers, home mgmt. multitide of Iles with a combined =overhead of less that 3 million dollars. It is out of whack. 
I have previously sent you tre following note that I wrote to you over a year ago. As=my acute disablity i.e a selective 
memory seems to be ra=sed often as a concern , I try to memorialize things in =riting in an attempt to lay out issues 
that might later be a probelm. ie what i would and wouldn=1439;t do , - my resposniblites. and those things that are 
not. things I thought that were needed to be done so that y=u wouldnt find yourself in the place where you currently 
find yourself. you chose to=defer most of the requests see below ,until weeks ago. you chose to =gnore the jpm acct. 
delayed the art partnership into this year. and though=the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that=you needed to do something re personnel you chose not to.

you very upset and a major pain in the ass. =AO I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people involved need to 
=e upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the begi=ning of my involvement ) I am also aware 
however of my overar=hing friendship obligations of ok, -given all the complexities =who else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. child=en with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking with little 
direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyo=e would report to him. 
eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long=shot my first choice as I prefer only being 
responsible and standing behind =y own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be transmi=ted to reflect 
status stated by others ) 
With =o commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to think 
through the problem creatively=. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you might find very 
costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sraring, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my terms 
doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator. not sure what role you prefer for=Eileen as 
you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Ric= your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom 
report to a =ew person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy gregory, I wo=ld suggest limiting to one person. The 
increasing public profile needs to be tak=n into consideration. 
talk later..c 
With your consen= eileen did not report to delson, she continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows=C2 Etc) 
and me. no one was hired to run YOUR office until two months ago =AO and even now at only 75 % of his time. eileen 
followed your instructions. not mine. in fact she continued to ignore=20 mine saying " but leon " . You would become 
frustrate= when i pointed out each instance. of her obfuscation. you were given the clear =AO choice and My team was 
not hired to do the contracting as opposed to architecture, you kept your own team. with eileen at the head. 
instructions were given by me„ detailed b=t ignored by your people. ( except in the instance where I did the work 
myself and force= answers ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? that being said =AO your calculation from where you 
were to where you are . you made a h=Il of a deal. -- negotiating down the original amount requested , call=ng on our
