God, and the word was God." - a' Christians often refer to Jesus as the embodied 'Word" of 
God. 
To philo p2251 sophers, invocation of the term "word" invites reflection on its 
ancient etymology in the term logos, which is also a synonym for "reason." '"3 When 
attesting to the credibility, skillfulness, or character of another, we put in "a word" for them 
(if we are delivering a negative report about someone, we do not call it putting in a "word"). 
^' 'Word" is used in urban slang to express agreement, concurrence, and affirmation.
Because it is infused with so much meaning to so many different constituents, Jensen's 
integrity discourse norm can help corporate boards develop governance dynamics which 
are responsive to the wide-ranging interests of multiple constituents. n'c* 
C. The Constitutionality of Prescriptive Discourse Norms in Corporate Governance 
Law 
This prescriptive discourse norms project attempts to grapple with the problems of 
corporate speech without resorting to the blunt instruments of censorship that the Supreme 
Court has forbidden. ^'°' Instead of imposing external restrictions on corporate commercial 
or political speech, this approach instead focuses on altering internal corporate 
governance dynamics in a way that is likely to generate more socially useful corporate 
speech. 
Moving from shareholder primacy to multi-stakeholder corporate governance attempts 
to change the way that corporations speak internally about and externally to corporate 
stakeholders. Regarding internal corporate dynamics, changing the fiduciary obligations of 
direc r226J tors of publicly traded corporations, and altering corporate discourse norms 
as a way of enforcing those obligations, does not run afoul of any First Amendment 
restrictions. Nobody has suggested that Smith v. Van Gorkom, "° which requires directors 
of Delaware corporations to engage in informed, good-faith discourse about what kind of 
corporate conduct is in the shareholders best interests, is an unconstitutional standard on 
First Amendment grounds. Nor has it been suggested that Van Gorkom, and nothing else, 
is a constitutionally required standard for corporate speech. If prescriptive discourse would 
be unconstitutional, then the current regime, which is highly prescriptive on its own terms, 
is unconstitutional. 
From the perspective developed by this Article, enforcing a fiduciary standard on 
external corporate speech to multiple stakeholders should not necessarily present First 
Amendment problems either. Presently corporations must adhere to fiduciary norms when 
speaking to shareholders. ^'"' This standard has not been criticized on First Amendment 
grounds because it has been assumed that the fiduciary discourse standard is part of the 
private contractual obligation between shareholders and their firms, rather than an 
externally imposed government regulation. 
I have argued that the relatively more lax 
discourse standards that presently govern corporate speech to non-shareholders should 
also be seen as an implicit term in the corporate "nexus-of-contracts." Altering that default 
term to provide for a fidu r2271 ciary discourse standard for corporate speech to workers 
and consumers should thus present no more daunting a First Amendment problem than 
does corporate law's present embrace of such a standard for corporate speech to 
shareholders. This article does not advocate banning shareholder primacy corporations or 
the non-fiduciary speech that such firms might speak to workers or consumers. Instead, it 
advocates setting the off-the-rack default terms for corporate charters in such a manner
