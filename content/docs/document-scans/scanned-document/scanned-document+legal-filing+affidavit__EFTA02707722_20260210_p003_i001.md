The Bank may at any time and from time to time (whether before or after revocation or 
termination of this Guaranty) without notice to Guarantor (except as required by law), 
without incurring responsibility to Guarantor, without impairing, releasing or otherwise 
affecting the obligations of Guarantor, in whole or in part, and without the endorsement 
or execution by Guarantor of any additional consent, waiver or guaranty: (a) change the 
manner, place or terms of payment, or change or extend the time of or renew, or change 
any interest rate or alter any Liability or Obligation or installment thereof, or any security 
therefor; (b) loan additional monies or extend additional credit to Borrower, with or 
without security, thereby creating new Liabilities or Obligations the payment or 
performance of which shall be guaranteed hereunder, and the Guaranty herein made shall 
apply to the Liabilities and Obligations as so changed, extended, surrendered, realized 
upon or otherwise altered; (c) sell, exchange, release, surrender, realize upon or otherwise 
deal with in any manner and in any order any property at any time pledged or mortgaged 
to secure the Liabilities or Obligations and offset against any such or other property; (d) 
exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against Borrower or others (including 
Guarantor or any other guarantor of the Liabilities or Obligations) or act or refrain from 
acting in any other manner; (e) settle or compromise any Liability or Obligation or any 
security therefor and subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of 
any Liability or Obligation of any other parties primarily or secondarily liable on any of 
the Liabilities or Obligations; (f) release or compromise any liability of Guarantor 
hereunder or any liability or obligation of any other parties primarily or secondarily liable 
on any of the Liabilities or Obligations; or (g) apply any sums from any sources to any 
Liability without regard to any Liabilities remaining unpaid. 
5. $ubordination. Guarantor agrees that it will not demand, take or 
receive from Borrower, by set-off or in any other manner, payment of any debt, now and 
at any time or times hereafter owing by Borrower to Guarantor unless and until all the 
Liabilities shall have been fully paid and the Obligations fully performed, and any 
security interest, liens or encumbrances which Guarantor now has and from time to time 
hereafter may have upon any of the assets of Borrower shall be nude subordinate, junior 
and inferior and postponed in priority, operation and effect to any security interest of the 
Bank in such assets. 
6. Waivers by the Bank. No delay on the part of the Bank in exercising 
any of its options, powers or rights, and no partial or single exercise thereof, shall 
constitute a waiver thereof. No waiver of any of its rights hereunder, and no modification 
or amendment of this Guaranty, shall be deemed to be made by the Bank unless the same 
shall be in writing, duly signed on behalf of the Bank; and each such waiver, if any, shall 
apply only with respect to the specific instance involved, and shall in no way impair the 
rights of the Bank or the obligations of Guarantor to the Bank in any other respect at any 
other time. 
7. Partial Invalidity and/or Enforceability of Guaranty. The 
unenforeeability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the 
enforceability or validity of any other provision herein and the invalidity or 
unenforceability of any provision of any Loan Document as it may apply to any person or
