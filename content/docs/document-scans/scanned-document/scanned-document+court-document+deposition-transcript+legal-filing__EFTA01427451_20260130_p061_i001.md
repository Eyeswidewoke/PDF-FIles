extensions involve considerable costs. In addition, it may be difficult to 
establish new supplier relationships and determine appropriate product 
selection when developing a new product or product line extension. Any new 
product or product line extension may not generate sufficient 
customer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the 
costs of its development and promotion and may reduce our operating 
income. In addition, any such unsuccessful effort may adversely affect our 
brand. If we are not able to anticipate, identify or develop and market 
products that respond to changes in requirements and preferences of pet 
parents and their pets or if our new product introductions or repositioned 
products fail to gain consumer acceptance, we may not grow our business as 
anticipated, our sales may decline and our business, financial 
condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
Any damage to our reputation or our brand may materially adversely affect 
our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Maintaining our strong reputation with consumers, our retail partners and 
our suppliers is critical to our success. Our brand may suffer if 
our marketing plans or product initiatives are not successful. The 
importance of our brand may increase if competitors offer more products with 
formulations similar to ours. Further, our brand may be negatively impacted 
due to real or perceived quality issues or if consumers perceive us as 
being untruthful in our marketing and advertising, even if such perceptions 
are not accurate. Product contamination, the failure to maintain high 
standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including raw materials 
and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations of product quality 
issues, mislabeling or contamination, even if untrue or caused by our third-
party contract manufacturers or raw material suppliers, may reduce 
demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. We 
maintain guidelines and procedures to ensure the quality, safety and 
integrity of our products. However, we may be unable to detect or prevent 
product and/or ingredient quality issues, mislabeling or contamination, 
particularly in instances of fraud or attempts to cover up or obscure 
deviations from our guidelines and procedures. For example, we recently 
discovered that a facility owned by a major supplier of ingredients to the 
pet food industry, including Blue Buffalo, for a period of time, had 
mislabeled as "chicken meal" or "turkey meal" ingredients that contained 
other poultry-based ingredients that were inappropriate for inclusion in 
"chicken meal" or "turkey meal" under industry standards, and it appears 
that this mislabeling was deliberate. If any of our products become unfit 
for consumption, cause injury or are mislabeled, we may have to engage in a 
product recall and/or be subject to liability. Damage to our reputation 
or our brand or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these 
or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and 
our business, financial condition and results of operations may be 
materially adversely affected. 
Our growth and business are dependent on trends that may change or not 
continue, and our historical growth may not be indicative of our 
future growth. 
The growth of the overall pet food industry depends primarily on the
