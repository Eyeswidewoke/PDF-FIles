Payments on a Global Note will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the registered owner thereof. The Co-
Issuers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent. the Initial Purchaser. the Placement Agent. the Collateral Manager and any of 
their respective Affiliates will not have arw responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or 
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Note or for maintaining, supervising or 
reviewing any records relating to the beneficial ownership interests. 
The Co-Issuers expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment in respect of a Global Note 
representing a Note held by DTC or its nominee, will immediately credit participants' accounts with payments in 
amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the stated principal amount of such Note as shown 
on the records of DTC or its nominee. The Co-Issuers also expect that payments by participants to owners of 
beneficial interests in a Global Note held through the participants will be governed by standing instructions and 
customary practices. as is now the cast with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of 
nominal for such customers. The payments will be the responsibility of the participants. 
Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules 
and will be settled in immediately available funds. If the laws of a jurisdiction require that certain persons take 
physical delivery of securities in definitive form the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such 
persons may be limited. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect 
participants and certain banks, the ability of a Person holding a beneficial interest in a Global Note to pledge its 
interest to a Person or entity that does not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of its 
interest. may be affected by the lack of a physical security. Transfers between participants in Euroclear and 
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. 
Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Securities described above and under 
"Purchase and Transfer Restrictions." cross-market transfers between DTC, on the one hand. and. directly or 
indirectly through Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other, will be effected through DTC in accordance 
with DTC rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, by its respective depositary; however, these 
cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Eurocicar or Clearstream. as applicable. by the 
counterparty in the system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (Brussels 
time for Euroclear and Luxembourg time for Clcarstrcam). Euroclear or Ckarstrcam as applicable, will, if the 
transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect 
final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in a Regulation S Global Note, and making or 
receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for immediately available funds settlement applicable to 
DTC. Clearstream participants and Euroclear participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositaries 
for Clearstream or Euroclear. 
Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant 
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a DTC participant will be credited during the securities settlement 
processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the DTC 
settlement date and the credit of any transactions in interests in a Global Note settled during the processing day will 
be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant on that day. Cash received in Euroclear or 
Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Eurocicar or Clearstream participant to 
a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant 
Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the Business Day following settlement through DTC. 
DTC has advised the Co-Issuers that it will take any action permitted to be taken by Holders of the Notes 
only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account with DTC an interest in a Global Note is credited 
and only in respect of that portion of the principal balance of the applicable Notes as to which the participant or 
participants has or have given direction. 
DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a member of 
the Federal Reserve System. a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial 
Code and a Clearing Agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section l7A of the Exchange Act. DTC was 
created to hold securities for its participants and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions 
between participants through electronic book-ently changes in accounts of its participants. thereby eliminating the 
need for physical movement of certificates. Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
