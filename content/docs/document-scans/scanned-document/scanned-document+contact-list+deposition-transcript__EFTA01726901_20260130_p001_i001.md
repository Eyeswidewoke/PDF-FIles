Return Protection - We'll Take It Back When Others Won't 
From time to time, merchants refuse to take back items you purchase 
at the store or online. That's why it's nice to know if you're dissatisfied 
with any eligible purchases you made with the Card and the 
merchant won't take it back, Return Protection can help. Perhaps the 
item is too big. Maybe you don't like the color. Simply contact us 
within 90 days from the date of purchase and American Express will 
reimburse you for the purchase price up to $300 per item, excluding 
shipping and handling. 
Return Protection refunds are limited to up to $1,000 annually per Card account. Coverage 
is subject to additional terms, conditions, and exclusions.
