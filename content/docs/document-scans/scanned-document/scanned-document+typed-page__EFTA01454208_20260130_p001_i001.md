Private Placement lariabiL Annuities 
A powerful tool to address income tax planning uses for 
high-net-worth individuals 
I
ncreasing taxes on the wealthy is very much part 
of the national dialogue. Most believe it's inevitable 
that marginal income tax rates will go up, especial-
ly for the clients we typically advise. At a minimum, 
there will likely be higher taxes on dividend income 
and, perhaps, all investment income. And, things like 
the charitable income tax deduction seem perilously 
at risk. 
The federal government is very focused on rais-
ing revenue, especially from Americans living abroad 
(evidenced by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance 
Act (FATCA) and other new reporting requirements). 
Sophisticated investment vehicles tend to generate 
investment gains that are subject to the highest effective 
tax rates. And, especially relevant for foundations, many 
sophisticated investment vehicles generate unrelated 
business taxable income (UBTI). Most high-net-worth 
individuals can shelter a paltry amount of their retire-
ment savings from income tax, making it all the more 
difficult to achieve their retirement objectives. Taken 
together, these trends create significant income tax plan-
ning challenges for high-net-worth clients. 
Advisors should consider using private placement 
variable annuities (PPVAs) to address these issues. A 
powerful yet simple tool compared to other planning 
alternatives, PPVAs are often overlooked. Well explore 
the opportunities for using PPVAs, as well as the 
mechanics for implementing them.

What It Is 
A PPVA is an annuity that's been stripped down to its 
most basic element gains are deferred from current 
period taxation (PPVA investment accounts). 
What It's Not 
L It's not a retail annuity. PPVA isn't a traditional 
annuity product. Most advisors are familiar with the 
high cost and limited investment choices of these 
products. PPVAs don't have the often expensive 
bells and whistles of retail annuity products, such 
as income guarantees or protection of principal 
in the event of premature death (which generally 
add an incremental fee of 100 basis points (bps) to 
200 bps annually). Instead, PPVA investment 
accounts generally have no upfront commission 
loads or premium tax charges, and assets can remain 
invested until a client chooses to take a one-time 
distribution or systematic payments over a specified 
period of time (often referred to as annuitization). 
The client isn't required to begin taking distributions 
until he reaches age 95 or 100, at which time most 
insurance companies require the account to be liqui-
dated over a period no longer than 30 years. 
2. It's not a contrivance. PPVAs are specifical-
ly authorized under Internal Revenue Code Sec-
tion 72. The Internal Revenue Service has repeat-
edly considered and ruled favorably on PPVAs, 
and, in 2008. issued clear safe-harbor guidelines for 
how investment funds offered within PPVA invest-
ment accounts (which are referred to as "insur-
ance-dedicated funds* or IDFs) must be structured 
and administered to qualify for favorable tax treat-
ment.' The client may make deposits into the PPVA 
investment account in any amount and at any time.
