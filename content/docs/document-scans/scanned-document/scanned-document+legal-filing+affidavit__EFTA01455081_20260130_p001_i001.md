governmental policies, action and inaction; macroeconomic or geopolitical and military events, including 
political instability in some oil-producing countries; and natural or nuclear disasters. Those events tend to 
affect prices worldwide, regardless of the location of the event. Market expectations about these events 
and speculative activity also cause prices to fluctuate. These factors may adversely affect the 
performance of the Reference Commodity and, as a result, the market value of the Notes, and the 
payment you will receive on the Notes, if any. 
Moreover, the prices of many of the commodities, particularly energy and agricultural commodities, 
reached historically high levels in 2009. Since reaching such highs, prices have fallen precipitously, to 
approximately 25% of their historic highs, in some cases, and prices have experienced unprecedented 
volatility since that time. In the case of many commodities, recent prices have also risen substantially, 
although they have not reached their historically high levels. There is no assurance that prices will again 
reach their historically high levels or that volatility will subside. It is possible that lower prices, or increased 
volatility, will adversely affect the performance of Reference Commodity and, as a result, the market value 
of the Notes. 
Changes in law or regulation relating to commodity futures contracts may adversely affect the 
market value of the Notes and the amount payable on your Notes 
Futures contracts and options on futures contracts, including those related to the Reference Commodity, 
are subject to extensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements. The Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, commonly referred to as the 'CFTC,- and the exchanges on which such futures contracts 
trade are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for 
example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the 
establishment of daily limits and the suspension of trading. Furthermore, certain exchanges have 
regulations that limit the amount of fluctuations in futures contract prices that may occur during a single 
five-minute trading period. These limits could adversely affect the market prices of relevant futures and 
options contracts and forward contracts. The regulation of commodity transactions in the U.S. is subject 
to ongoing modification by govemment and judicial action. In addition, various non-U.S. governments 
have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the commodity markets 
and the need to regulate the derivative markets in general. The effect on the value of the Notes of any 
future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but could be substantial and adverse to the interests of 
holders of the Notes. 
For example, the Dodd—Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank"), which 
was enacted on July 21, 2010, requires the CFTC to establish limits on the amount of positions that may 
be held by any person in futures contracts on a commodity, options on such futures contracts and swaps 
that are economically equivalent to such contracts. In particular, on October 18, 2011, the CFTC adopted 
interim and final position limits that would have applied to a party's combined futures, options and swaps 
position in any one of 28 physical commodities and economically equivalent futures, options and swaps. 
These limits would have, among other things, expanded existing position limits applicable to options and 
futures contracts to apply to swaps and applied them across affiliated and controlled entities and 
accounts. However, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Securities Industry and 
Financial Markets Association jointly filed a legal challenge to the position limit rules, which were due to 
take effect on October 12, 2012, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On September 28, 
2012, the court vacated the position limit rules and remanded them to the CFTC. The CFTC announced 
on November 15, 2012 that it will appeal the court's decision. If position limit rules are ultimately upheld 
in an appeal or if substantially similar rules are adopted and implemented by the CFTC, such rules could 
interfere with our ability to enter into or maintain hedge positions in instruments subject to the limits, and 
consequently, we may need to decide, or be forced, to sell a portion, possibly a substantial portion, of our 
hedge position in the Reference Commodity or futures contracts on the Reference Commodity or related 
contracts. Similarly, other market participants would be subject to the same regulatory issues and could 
decide, or be required to, sell their positions in the Reference Commodity or futures contracts on the 
Reference Commodity or related contracts. While the effects of these or other regulatory developments 
are difficult to predict, if this broad market selling were to occur, it would likely lead to declines, possibly 
significant declines, in the price of the Reference Commodity or futures contracts on the Reference 
Commodity and therefore, the value of and return on the Notes. 
Other regulatory organizations have proposed, and in the future may propose, further reforms similar to 
those enacted by the Dodd-Frank Act or other legislation which could have an adverse impact on the
