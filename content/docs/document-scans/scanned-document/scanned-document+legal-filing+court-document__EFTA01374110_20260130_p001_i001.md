AGP LP 519 Alpha Group Capital Paul Barrett 
Partnership Agreement, whether or not any income is paid out to such Partner. Such items of taxable 
income, deduction and loss will be required to be taken into account in the taxable year of the Partner in 
which the fiscal year of the Partnership ends. 
Under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), a partnership 
that meets the definition of a "publicly traded partnership' may be taxable as a corporation. It is expected 
that the Partnership will not be treated as a "publicly traded partnership.- However, even if it were 
considered to be publicly traded, the Partnership would be taxed as a corporation only if less than 90% of its 
gross income for any taxable year consisted of -qualifying income," which term includes, among other 
things, interest, dividends, and gains from the sale of securities. It is anticipated that 90% or more of the 
Partnership's income for each taxable year will be "qualifying income," and that, accordingly, even if the 
Partnership were considered to be publicly traded, it would still be treated as a partnership for Federal 
income tax purposes. If the Partnership were taxed as a corporation, the Partnership's income would be 
subject to corporate income tax, which would significantly reduce the retum that an investor would derive 
from the Partnership. 
The Partnership invests substantially all of its assets through a "master-feeder structure in the 
Master Fund, which is a Cayman Islands exempted company. Although the Master Fund will be subject to 
a 30% Federal withholding tax with respect to dividends and certain interest income considered to be from 
sources within the United States, the Partnership's share of such income should not be subject to this 
withholding tax. The Master Fund has elected to be treated as a partnership for Federal income tax 
purposes and, consequently, will not be a taxable entity for Federal income tax purposes. The Partnership 
will take into account for Federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the Master Fund's income and 
loss. 
Under the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner will have the discretion to allocate specially 
an amount of the Partnership's taxable gains or losses to a retiring Partner to the extent that the Partner's 
capital account exceeds, or is less than, such Partner's Federal income tax basis in such Partner's 
partnership interest. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") would 
accept such a special allocation. If the special allocation was successfully challenged by the IRS, the 
Partnership's taxable gains or losses allocable to the remaining Partners would be increased. 
The Master Fund will be required each year to make the determination as to whether it will take the 
position for Federal income tax purposes that it is (i) a trader in securities or (ii) an investor in securities. 
This determination will be made separately each year based primarily on the level of the Master Fund's 
securities activities during the particular year. Accordingly, the Master Fund's status as a trader or an 
investor may vary from year to year and is difficult to predict in advance. If the Master Fund is characterized 
as a trader, each Partner who is an individual may deduct his or her share of the expenses of the Master 
Fund (other than interest expense) under Section 162 of the Code as business expenses. Alternatively, if 
the Master Fund is characterized as an investor, the expenses of the Master Fund (other than interest 
expense) would be investment expenses deductible under Section 212 of the Code and as such, would be 
deductible by an individual only to the extent that his or her share of such expenses, when combined with 
his or her other "miscellaneous itemized deductions." exceeds 2% of his or her adjusted gross income. 
Further, the amount in excess of such 2% floor would be subject to the overall limitation on itemized 
deductions imposed by Section 68 of the Code. Also, the amount in excess of such 2% floor would not be 
deductible in computing the alternative minimum tax for an individual taxpayer. The Partnership will also be 
required to determine whether expenses incurred directly by the Partnership itself are business expenses 
or investment expenses that are subject to the foregoing limitations on deductibility. Payments made by the 
Master Fund or the Partnership with respect to notional principal contracts, such as swaps, may be subject 
to the foregoing limitations on deductibility. Expenses connected with the marketing and issuing of 
Partnership interests are not deductible. 
Interest expense of the Partnership and the Master Fund generally will be considered "investment 
interest" for Federal income tax purposes. Generally, investment interest is deductible by an individual only 
to the extent of his or her net investment income (which for this purpose generally does not include net 
long-term capital gains or "qualified dividend income"). Investment interest which is not deductible in any 
taxable year because of this limitation may be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year.
