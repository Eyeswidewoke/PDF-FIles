Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa F... Page 6 of 32 
just as apt to see Russian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-educated 
Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her own helicopter and was recently seen dining 
with Clinton at Nello's on Madison Avenue), lives in her own townhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is 
frequently seen around town with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no boldfaced name 
to replace Maxwell. "You may read about Jeffrey in the social columns, but there is much more to him 
than that," says Jeffrey T. Leeds of the private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. "He's a talented money 
manager and an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual, though, is that in this 
media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-promoter." 
Born in 1953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayette High School. According to his bio, 
he took some classes in physics at Cooper Union from 1969 to 1971. He left Cooper Union in 1971 and 
attended NYU's Courant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the heart, 
leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between 1973 and 1975, Epstein taught calculus and physics 
at the Dalton School. 
By most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets Society type of figure, 
wowing his high-school classes with passionate mathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street 
father of a student that he said to Epstein point-blank: "What are you doing teaching math at Dalton? 
You should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace Greenberg a call." 
Epstein was in many respects the perfect candidate for Greenberg's consideration. Greenberg, a senior 
partner at Bear Stearns at the time and a legendary trader in his own right, has long made it clear that it's 
the hungry, brilliant guys lacking the fancy degrees that he favors at Bear. They even have an acronym: 
PSDs — poor, smart, and a deep desire to be rich. It was a description that fit Epstein to a T. He was a 
Brooklyn guy with a motor for a brain, and while he did love teaching, this close-up view of the rarefied 
Upper East Side life of his students' gave him a taste for the big time. 
So in 1976, he dropped everything and reported to work at Bear Stearns, where he started off as a junior 
assistant to a floor trader at the American Stock Exchange. His ascent was rapid. 
At the time, options trading was an arcane and dimly understood field, just beginning to take off. To 
trade options, one had to value them, and to value them, one needed to be able to master such abstruse 
mathematical confections as the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For Epstein, breaking down such 
models was pure sport, and within just a few years he had his own stable of clients. "He was not your 
conventional broker saying 'Buy IBM' or 'Sell Xerox,' " says Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne. "Given 
his mathematical background, we put him in our special-products division, where he would advise our 
wealthier clients on the tax implications of their portfolios. He would recommend certain tax-
advantageous transactions. He is a very smart guy and has become a very important client for the firm as 
well." 
In 1980, Epstein made partner, but he had left the firm by 1981. Working in a bureaucracy was not for 
him; what's more, in rubbing up against ever greater sums of money during his time at Bear, he began to 
feel the need to grab his own piece of the action. 
In 1982, according to those who know Epstein, he set up his own shop, J. Epstein and Co., which 
remains his core business today. The premise behind it was simple: Epstein would manage the 
individual and family fortunes of clients with $1 billion or more. Which is where the mystery deepens. 
Because according to the lore, Epstein, in 1982, immediately began collecting clients. There were no 
road shows, no whiz-bang marketing demos — just this: Jeff Epstein was open for business for those 
with $1 billion—plus.
