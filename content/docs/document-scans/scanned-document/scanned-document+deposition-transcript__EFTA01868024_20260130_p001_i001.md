Re: 
Hello Jeffrey! Sorry for not answering so long, Im ok. But Im lying Im not ok. 
but its personal. Just feeling too bad inside and fed up of everything here. Im 
at work all day and my skype is online here every work day from 9 to 6. but I 
cant talk. then usually I go home and study. 
Trying to do my best with marks to have scholarship. Writing to you right now 
with tears in my eyes but I cant cry on my workplace and mascara is too 
expensive to spoil. To tell the truth I feel like Im living to take everybody's 
problems and wishes and nobody wanta to hear me. I dont speak with my parents. 
From that time. My only parents who loved me all my life and each other also, 
doesn't do it to me and between them also anymore. it hurts. I know they love 
me, Im not a 13 year child to blame them that they dont love me its stupid. but 
the fact is that we are not together. Trully, when I came here, it was good. My 
friends missed me, my boyfrend took care of me, helped to find a job, put his 
sholder when i need that. I gave him every happy moment I could. 
I was with him my first time. That was my second time after you. you was the 
other person who changed me. You have seen how afraid i was, how shy I was and 
you made me a woman, you made me feel like a woman. You made me beleive that Im 
beautiful and you like it. I remember everything and I used it. Week ago I 
understood that he had another girlfriend and she is good smart virgin. I know 
thats stupid for you and you even shouldnt read that shit Im writing to you. But 
I want. Not because I dont have anyone to share with, but because it is you. It 
is so difficult you know, the person to whom you beleived and who told you 
hourly how does he want to change my last name to his... Oh, whatever. Im much 
stronger than he thinks. Than everybody thinks. Im tired of being here. If I 
only had a chance my dream would be a flight next minute. Im trying to make my 
visa, I have been consultaing some representatives from embassy but nothing 
heared from them. Remember I brought you a letter. so I cant understand my 
situation clearly, maybe you can know. Jeffrey knows everything huh =) so I 
off icialy ws changing my visa from O1 to B2 and I off icialy had rights to stay 
in US untill I will receive an answer despite the fact that my jl visa expired 
at october. 
did the same and she got her letter in November with "yes" and 
then went home. I was waiting untill the end of January with the words WE need 
more documents why u stay here untill 16th of February. I went home at 14th. I 
didnt hear the no and didnt hear the yes. What if I could not have chance to 
fligh away in october but I need it in November what should I do without the 
letter which came only in January? And I have my ticket from October, it is 
expired but I had it can be a document that I just became sick and couldnt go 
home. This is the first problem the second is court and you know about it. I 
dont think they can give me jl student visa its ridiculous I should give them 
something more serious and reasonable. I will think about it. Concerning my 
teeth I started them, the took off one of them the day before yesterday and it 
didnt hurt , I remembered the time when I was at the dentist with you and that 
awesome lady told me "are you sure you it will not hurt, you are with Jeffrey, I 
dont wanna be a dentist in jail if something wrong" hahaha . I suppose next 
week I will definetely have them. Thank you so much I would never put them if 
you didnt tell me , I was shy. they are ugly. Also, I would like to ask do you 
still need those tiles, because as far as I understood, you need something good 
and special we have a lot of simple tiles which doesnt worth to be transported 
to NY because there are more better of them everywhere, but I found those which 
are handmade and was even used for restoration of registan mosque. I went to 
them and took some pictures they are on my disk if you need them I can send you 
but actually they told they can make any print you need professionaly and 
fast.Thank you for money transfer. You sent me more than I asked, I had 
something to cover my daily problems and pay for everything. Took 150 from that
