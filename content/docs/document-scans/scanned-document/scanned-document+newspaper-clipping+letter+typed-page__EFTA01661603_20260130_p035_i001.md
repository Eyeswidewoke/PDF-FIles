n Manhattan's 
Upper Eaft Side. home to some of the 
most apensive real estate on earth. exists 
the crown jewel of the city's residential 
town houses. With its 15-kot-high oak door. 
huge arched windows, and nine floors. it 
sits on—or. rather. commands--the block 
of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison 
Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of pro-
portion with its four- and five-story neigh-
bors, it seems more like an institution than 
a house. This is perhaps not surprising—
until 1989 it was the Birch Aachen private 
school. Now it is said to be Manhattan's 
largest private residence. 
Inside. amid the flurry of menservants 
attired in sober black suits and pristine 
white gloves, you feel you have stumbled 
into someone's private Xanadu. This is 
no mere rich person's home. but a high-
walled. eclectic, imperious fantasy that 
seems to have no boundaries. 
The entrance ball is decorated not with 
paintings but with row upon row of indi-
vidually framed eyeballs: these, the owner 
tells people with relish. were imported from 
England. where they were made for in-
jured soldiers. Nat comes a marble foyer. 
which does have a painting, in the man-
ner of Jean Dubullet .. . but the host coyly 
refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any 
case. guests are like pygmies next to the 
nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked 
African warrior. 
Despite its eccentricity the house is curi-
ously impersonal. the statement of someone 
who wants to be known for the scale of his 
possessions. Its occupant. financier Jeffrey 
Epstein. 50. admits to friends that he likes it 
when people think of him this way. A good-
looking man. resembling Ralph Lauren. 
with thick gray-white hair and a weathered 
face. he usually dresses in jeans, knit shirts. 
and loafers. He tells people he bought the 
house because he knew he "could never live 
anywhere bigger." He thinks 51,000 square 
feet is an appropriately large space for some-
one like himself, who deals mostly in large 
concepts—especially large sums of money. 
Guests are invited to lunch or dinner at 
the town house—Epstein usually refers to the 
former as "tea," since he likes to eat bite-
size morsels and drink copious quantities of 
Earl Grey. (He does not touch alcohol or to-
bacco.) Tea is served in the "leather room." 
so called because of the cordovan-colored 
fabric on the walls. The chairs arc covered 
in a leopard print, and on the wall hangs a 
huge. Oriental fantasy of a woman holding 
an opium pipe and caressing a snarling li-
onskin. Under her gaze. plates of finger 
sandwiches arc delivered to Epstein and 
guests by the menservants in white gloves. 
Upstairs, to the right of a spiral stair-
case, is the "office." an enormous gallery 
spanning the width of the house. Strangely, 
it holds no computer. Computers belong in 
the "computer room" to smaller room at 
the back of the house). Epstein has been 
known to say. The office features a gilded 
desk (which Epstein tells people belonged 
to banker J. P Morgan). 18th-century black 
lacquered Portuguese cabinets. and a nine-
foot ebony Steinway "D- grand. On the 
desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de 
Sade's The Miatimunes of l'inue was re-
cently spotted. Covering the :loon Epstein 
has explained. "is the largest Persian rug 
you'll ever see in a private home—so big. it 
must have come from a mosque." Amid 
such splendor, much of which reflects the 
work of the French decorator Alberto Pin-
to. who has worked for Jacques Chirac and 
the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Ara-
bia. there is one particularly startling oddi-
ty: a stuffed black poodle. standing atop 
the grand piano. "No decorator would ever 
tell you to do that.- Epstein brags to visi-
tors. "But I want people to think what it 
means to stuff a dog:' People can't help 
but feel it's Epstein's way of saying that he 
always has the last word. 
In addition to the town house. Epstein 
lives in what is reputed to be the largest 
private dwelling in New Mexico. on an SI8 
million. 7.500-acre ranch which he named 
"Zorro." "It makes the town house look like 
a shack.- Epstein has said. He also owns 
Little St. James. a 70-acre island in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. where the main house 
is currently being renovated by Edward Tut-
tle. a designer of the Amanresorts. There is 
also a S6.8 million house in Palm Beach, 
Florida. and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream 
IV. a helicopter. and a Boeing - 27. replete 
with trading room. on which Epstein re-
cently flew President Clinton. actors Chris 
Tucker and Kevin Spacey. supermarket 
magnate Ron Burkle. Lew Wasserman's 
grandson. Casey Wasserman. and a few oth-
ers. on a mission to explore the problems of 
AIDS and economic development in Africa. 
Epstein is charming. but he doesn't let 
the charm slip into his eyes. They arc steely 
and calculating, giving some hint at the 
steady whir of machinery running behind 
them. "Let's play chess." he said to me, af-
ter refusing to give an interview for this arti-
cle. "You be white. You get the first move." 
It was an appropriate metaphor for a man 
who seems to feel he can win no matter 
what the advantage of the other side. His 
advantage is that no one really seems to 
know him or his history completely or what 
his arsenal actually consists of. He has care-
fully engineered it so that he remains one 
of the few truly baffling mysteries among 
New York's moneyed world. People know 
snippets. but few know the whole. 
"He's very enigmatic." says Rosa Nlonck-
ton, the former C.E.O. of Tiflany & Co. in 
the U.K. and a close friend since the early 
1980s. "You think you know him and then 
you peel off another 'ring of the onion skin 
and there's something else extraordinary 
underneath. He never reveals his hand.. . . 
He's a classic iceberg. What you see is not 
what you get." 
ven acquaintances sense a 
curious dichotomy: Yes. he 
lives like a "modern ma-
haraja.- as Leah Kiernan. 
one of his art dealers. puts 
it. Yet he is fastidiously, al-
most obsessively private—he 
lists himself in the phone book under a 
pseudonym. He rarely attends society gath-
erings or weddings or funerals: he considers 
eating in restaurants like "eating on the sub-
way"—i.e.. something he'd never do. There 
are many women in his life. mostly >oung, 
but there is no one of them to whom he 
has been able to commit. He describes his 
most public companion of the last decade. 
Ghislaine Maxwell. 41. the daughter of the 
late. disgraced media baron Robert Max-
well. as simply his "best friend." He says 
she is not on his payroll, but she seems 
to organize much of his life—recently she 
was making telephone inquiries to find a 
California-based yoga instructor for him. 
(Epstein is still close to his two other long-
term girlfriends, Paula Heil Fisher. a for-
mer associate of his at the brokerage firm 
Bear Stearns and now an opera producer, 
and Eva Andersson Dubin, a doctor and 
onetime model. He tells people that when 
a relationship is over the girlfriend "moves 
up. not down." to friendship status.) 
Some of the businessmen who dine with 
him at his home--they include newspaper 
publisher Mort Zuckerman, banker Louis 
Ranieri. Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman. 
real-estate tycoon Leon Black. former Mi-
crosoft executive Nathan Myhrvold. Tom 
Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels). and real-estate
