Investor thereto, then the Partnership may convert such Advisory Class Investors Series Three Interest into 
a Series One Interest and charge the Management Fee due with respect to Series One Interests 
accordingly. 
Series Four Interests are only being offered to Limited Partners who invest in the Partnership 
through a wrap fee program (as further described below). 
In order to track the Management Fee, Incentive Allocation and withdrawal terms for each series of 
interests, Limited Partners who invest in more than one series will have a separate capital account for each 
series. 
Series Four Interests 
Limited Partners purchasing Series Four Interests will be charged the Management Fee at the rate 
of 1.25% per annum and generally will be permitted to make withdrawals as of the last business day of any 
calendar quarter. Series Four Interests are offered only to Limited Partners whose investment in the 
Partnership is made through a fee-based advisory program sponsored by a registered broker-dealer or 
registered investment adviser (also known as a "wrap fee"' program) where the broker-dealer's registered 
representative or the registered investment adviser, as applicable, recommends their investment in the 
Partnership. A "registered representative is a person who works for a brokerage company that is licensed 
by the SEC and regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") and acts as an 
account executive for clients trading investment products such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. 
Not all Limited Partners will be able to access the Series Four Interests. Certain financial advisory 
firms may not offer fee-based advisory programs that would allow Limited Partners to access the Series 
Four Interests as described above or Limited Partners may not qualify for any such program at their 
financial advisory firms that would allow such access. It is also possible that certain financial advisory firms 
may not offer the Partnership as part of any such fee-based advisory program. 
Further, the decision by Limited Partners to invest in the Partnership through Series Four Interests 
must be made on a case by case basis after careful discussion with the Limited Partners financial advisor to 
determine which series is most appropriate for the Limited Partner, such determination to be based both on 
economic and non-economic factors. 
The General Partner reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the Limited Partners who 
are eligible to hold Series Four Interests. To the extent a Limited Partner is no longer eligible to hold Series 
Four Interests, the Limited Partner must promptly notify the General Partner of the change in its status and 
the General Partner, in its sole discretion, may exchange such Limited Partners Series Four Interests into 
Series Two Interests or mandatorily withdraw the Limited Partner's Series Four Interests. 
Capital Contributions 
The minimum initial investment in the Partnership is $1,000,000 and the minimum additional 
investment is $25,000, both subject to waiver, reduction or change in the sole discretion of the General 
Partner. In general, the Partnership will accept capital contributions monthly: however, the General Partner 
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to accept capital contributions at other times. Capital contributions 
by Limited Partners must be made in cash. 
The General Partner may admit additional or substitute general partners to the Partnership who are 
affiliates of the General Partner, provided that the General Partner will give 30 days' written notice to all 
Limited Partners of the proposed admission of any additional or substitute general partner.
