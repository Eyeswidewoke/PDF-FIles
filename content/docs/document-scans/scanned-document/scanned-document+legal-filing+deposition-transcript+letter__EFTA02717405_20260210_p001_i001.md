The Reality Club 
From 1981 through 1996, The Reality Club held its meetings in Chinese =estuarants, artists lofts, the Board Rooms of 
Rockefeller University, =he New York Academy of Sciences, and investment banking firms, =allrooms, museums, and 
living rooms, among other venues. In January, =997, The Reality Club has now migrated to the Internet on Edge. Here 
=ou will find a number of today's sharpest minds taking their ideas into =he bull ring knowing they will be challenged. 
The ethic is thinking =mart vs. the anesthesiology of wisdom. 
Through the years, The Reality Club has had a simple criterion for =hoosing speakers. We look for people whose creative 
work has expanded =ur notion of who and what we are. A few Reality Club speakers and/or =dge presenters are 
bestselling authors or are famous in the mass =ulture. Most are not. Rather, we encourage work on the cutting edge of 
=he culture, and the investigation of ideas that have not been generally =xposed. We are interested in "thinking smart;" 
we are not interested in =he anesthesiology of "wisdom." The motto of the Club is "to arrive at =he edge of the world's 
knowledge, seek out the most complex and =ophisticated minds, put them in a room together, and have them ask each 
=ther the questions they are asking themselves." 
We charge the speakers to represent an idea of reality by describing =heir creative work, their lives, and the questions 
they are asking =hemselves. We also want them to share with us the boundaries of their =nowledge and experience and 
to respond to the challenges, comments, =riticisms, and insights of the members. The Reality Club is a point of =iew, not 
just a group of people. Reality is an agreement. The constant =hifting of metaphors, the intensity with which we advance 
our ideas to =ach other — this is what intellectuals do. The Reality Club draws =ttention to the larger context of 
intellectual life. 
Speakers seldom get away with loose claims. Maybe a challenging question =ill come from a member who knows an 
alternative theory that really =hreatens what the speaker had to say. Or a member might come up with a =reat idea, 
totally out of left field, that only someone outside the =peaker's field could come up with. This creates a very interesting 
=ynamic. 
The most challenging evenings are when the speakers present the =uestions they are asking themselves. This is in 
contrast to evenings =uring which the speakers discuss questions they have already answered. =n communications 
theory information is not defined as data or input but =ather as "a difference that makes a difference." It is this level I 
=ope the speakers will achieve. We want speakers who are willing to take =heir ideas into the bull ring. 
The Reality Club encourages people who can take the materials of the =ulture in the arts, literature, and science and put 
them together in =heir own way. We live in a mass-produced culture where many people, =ven many established 
cultural arbiters limit themselves to secondhand =deas, thoughts, and opinions. The Reality Club consists of individuals 
=ho create their own reality and do not accept an ersatz, appropriated =eality. Our members are out there doing it 
rather than talking about =nd analyzing the people who are doing it. 
The more than one hundred and fifty individuals who have made =resentations at Reality Club meetings and the more 
recent EDGE Seminars =nclude a wide range of people in the arts and sciences: actor Ellen =urstyn; philosopher Daniel C. 
0ennett; scientists Richard Dawkins, =reeman Dyson, Niles Eldredge, Murray Gell-Mann, Stephen Jay Gould, =tewart 
Kauffman, Benoit Mandelbrot, Lynn Margulis, and George Williams; =sychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Howard 
Gardner, Steven Pinker, =nd Roger Schank; artists Gretchen Bender, Peter Halley, April Gornick, =nd Gary Stephan; poets 
Michael McClure, Paul Mariani, and Gerd Stern; =eligious scholars Richard Baker-roshi, Elaine Pagels, and Robert
