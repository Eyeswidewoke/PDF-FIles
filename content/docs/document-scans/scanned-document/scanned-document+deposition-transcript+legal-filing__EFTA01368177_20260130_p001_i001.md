ALEXIS BREANNA GLADDEN v. CUMBERLAND TRUST AND INVESTMENT COMPANY, ET AL 
Appeal from the Circuit Court for Hamblen County 
No. 12-CV-119 Thomas J. Wright. Judge 
No. E2015-00941-00A-R9-CV-FILED-MARCH 24, 2016 
We granted an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 9 in this case to consider whether the signature of the trustee of the 
Alexis Breanna Gladden Irrevocable Trust ("the Trust) on an investment/brokerage account agreement agreeing to arbitration binds 
the minor beneficiary of the Trust to conduct arbitration of unknown future disputes or claims. We find and hold that while the plain 
language of the trust agreement does allow the trustee to agree to arbitrate claims and disputes that have arisen, it does not allow the 
trustee to agree to arbitration of unknown future disputes or claims. Therefore, the signature of the trustee of the Trust on an 
investmentbrolcerage account agreement agreeing to arbitration does not bind the minor beneficiary to conduct arbitration of unknown 
future disputes or claims.
