I ORIGINS 
for purposes. things are intentionally 
caused, things are intentionally caused for a 
purpose by some agent. ... You begin to see 
that a god is a likely thing fora human mind 
to construct." 
Other researchers find the work intrigu-
ing. "If her data are right, we all from child-
hood have a bias to see the natural world as 
purposefully designed," says Barrett. "It's 
a small step to suppose that the design has 
a designer." 
This predisposition to "creationist" 
explanations has resonance with another ten-
dency in the human mind, says Barrett—
something he calls the "hypersensitive 
agency detection deviceTM: looking for a 
thinking "being" even in nonliving things. In 
classic experiments in the 1940s, psycholo-
gists found that people watching animations 
of circles, triangles, and squares darting 
about could identify various shapes as char-
acters and infer a narrative. Anthropologist 
Stewart Guthrie noted in 1993 that this ten-
dency could help explain religion, because 
it implies we attribute "agency" to all kinds 
of inanimate objects and 
ambiguous signals. As Barrett 
describes it: "When I hear a 
bump in the night. 1 think 
'Who's there?' not 'What's 
Who made it? Studies suggest that 
children tend toward creationist 
explanations of natural phenomena. 
there?' ... Given ambiguous stimuli, we 
often posit an agency at play:' 
Guthrie suggested that natural selection 
primed this system for false positives, because 
if the bump in the night is really 
a burglar—or a lion—you 
could be in danger, while if its 
just the wind. no harm done. 
Of course, this is still a 
long way from believing in 
gods or spirits. But a hair-
trigger agency detector could 
work with another sophisti-
cated element of the human 
mind to make us prone to 
believe in gods, cognitive 
researchers say. They refer to 
what's called theory of mind, 
or the understanding that 
another being has a mind with 
intentions, desires, and beliefs 
of its own. Studies have 
shown that this ability develops over timc in 
children and is usually present by age 5; 
functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMR1) studies have localized the parts of the 
brain involved. 
If you suspect that an agent was 
responsible for some mysteri-
ous event, it's a short step

to thinking that the agent has a mind like 
your own. "Higher order theory of mind 
enables you to represent mental states of 
beings not immediately or visibly present, 
and who could have a 
very different perspec-
tive than your own," says 
Barrett. "That's what you 
need to have a rich repre-
sentation of what it might 
be like to be a god." (It's 
• 
also what is needed to 
have a functional reli-
gion, because people 
• 
need to know that others 
share their beliefs.) As 
Darwin put it, humans 
developing religion 
"would naturally attrib-
ute to spirits the same 
passions, the same love of 
vengeance, or simplest 
form of justice, and the same affections 
which they themselves feel." 
Some fM RI studies lend support to this 
idea. In the 24 March issue of the Proceed-
ings of the National Academy of Sciences, a 
team led by Jordan Grafman of the National 
Institute of Neurological Disorders and 
Stroke in Bethesda, Maryland, asked 40 peo-
ple to evaluate statements about God's emo-
tions and relationships to humans, such as. 
"God is removed from the world" and "God 
is forgiving," while they were in an fM RI 
scanner. The researchers found that the areas 
that lit up (indicating oxygen uptake and so 
presumably brain activity), such as the infe-
rior frontal gyros on both sides of the brain. 
are also involved in theory of mind. This and 
other results argue against any special "god 
region" of the brain as some have suggested. 
says Grafman. Rather, he says. "religious 
belief co-opts widely distributed brain sec-
tors, including many concerned with so-
called theory of mind." 
Other researchers are extending this cog-
nitive model, finding additional thought 
processes that they say make religious belief 
natural. For example. Bloom and Jesse
