approximately $101,850. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other 
income earned on the amounts held in the trust account. We do not expect the interest earned on the amount in the 
trust account will be sufficient to pay our 
66 
taxes. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our 
initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the mist account will be used as working capital to 
finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth 
strategies. 
Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we will have available to us the approximately 
$1.000,000 of proceeds held outside the trust ace/amt. We will use these funds primarily to identify and evaluate 
target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, 
plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate 
documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses structure, negotiate and complete a business 
combination, and to pay taxes to the extent the interest earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our 
taxes. 
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended 
initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers, directors and 
director nominees may. but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial 
business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination 
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned 
amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such 
loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at 
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holder. 
The terms of such loans by our officers, directors and director nominees, if any, have not been determined and no 
written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our 
sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and 
provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 
We expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $400,000 for legal, 
accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting 
successful business combinations; $150,000 for legal and accounting foes related to regulatory' reporting 
requirements; $75,000 for NASDAQ and other regulatory fees: $240,000 for office space, administrative and 
support services; $50,000 as a icsia ve for liquidation expenses and approximately $85.000 for general working 
capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves. 
These amounts arc estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a 
portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us 
with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a "no-shop" provision (a provision designed 
to keep target businesses from "shopping- around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable 
to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have 
any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity 
from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to funds "no-shop" provision would 
be determined based on the tem of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the 
time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having 
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target 
businesses. 
We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the 
expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target 
business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination arc less than the 
actual amount necessary to do so. we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our 
business combination.

Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we 
become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our business 
combination, in which cast we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business 
combination. In the current economic environment, it has become especially difficult to obtain acquisition 
financing. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds 
available to us. we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our 
initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order 
to meet our obligations.
