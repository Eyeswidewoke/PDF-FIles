Engine, APU or Part or any of the other Collateral, whether or not in Agent's possession, in one or more 
parcels, at public or private sale or sales, with no less than ten (10) working days' prior notice to Borrower 
of any proposed sale or lease of the Airframe or any Engine, which Borrower acknowledges as 
constituting 'reasonable prior notice' for the purposes of the Cape Town Convention, at such prices as 
Agent may deem best; (vi) apply any deposit, other cash collateral, or collect and apply proceeds to 
reduce any amounts due to Agent and/or Lenders; (vii) terminate any Third Party Agreement, without 
regard as to the existence of any event of default thereunder and recover, or cause Borrower and any 
party to any Third Party Agreement and any Person taking by or through any of them to relinquish 
possession and return the Aircraft, including the Engines, APU and Parts, pursuant to this Section 5, 
and/or exercise any and all other remedies under any Third Party Agreements, or in Borrower's stead; to 
the extent provided for under, or otherwise available to Borrower in connection with any Third Party 
Agreement; (viii) collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof; (ix) 
demand and obtain from any court speedy relief pending final determination available at law (including, 
without limitation, possession, control, custody or immobilization of the Aircraft or preservation of the 
Aircraft or its fair market value); (x) procure the deregistration (whether by utilizing the IDERA or 
otherwise) and/or export and physical transfer of the Aircraft from the territory in which it is then situated; 
and (xi) exercise any and all other remedies allowed by Applicable Law. including, without limitation, the 
Cape Town Convention and the UCC. Agent or either Lender shall have the right upon any such public 
sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the 
whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in Borrower, which 
right or equity of redemption is hereby expressly released. Borrower further agrees, at Agent's request, 
to assemble the Collateral, make it available to Agent at such places as Agent shall reasonably select, 
whether at Borrowers premises or elsewhere. Agent shall deliver to each Lender its pro rata share of the 
net proceeds of any such realization (after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind 
incurred in connection therewith) (*Net Proceeds') based on such Lenders pro rata share of the 
Obligations then outstanding first, to be applied to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations in such 
order and manner as Lenders may elect, and second, any excess remaining after such application, to be 
disbursed to Borrower. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Borrower waives all claims, damages 
and demands against Agent and each Lender arising out of the repossession, retention, sale or other 
disposition of the Collateral, except any claims or damages related to or arising out of the gross 
negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or such Lender and any claims to any excess Net Proceeds 
remaining after the application of any Net Proceeds in accordance with the immediately preceding 
sentence. Borrower agrees that Agent need not give more than ten (10) working days' notice (as 
contemplated under the Cape Town Convention) of the time and place of any public sale or of the time 
after which a private sale may take place and that such notice is reasonable notification of such matters. 
Borrower shall be liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are 
insufficient to pay in full the Obligations. 
5.2 
Relief Pending Final Determination. 
Without limiting the generality of Agent's other 
remedies set forth in this Section 5, in the event Agent adduces evidence of an Event of Default by 
Borrower, Agent may. pending final determination of its claim, obtain from a court speedy (as defined in 
Article 20 of the Cape Town Convention) relief in the form of such one or more of the following orders as 
Agent requests: 
(a) preservation of the Aircraft and its value; 
(b) possession, control or custody of the Aircraft 
(c) 
immobilization of the Aircraft; 
(d) lease or, except where covered by subparagraphs (a) to (c), management of the 
Aircraft and the income therefrom; and 
(e) if at any time Borrower and Agent specifically agree, sale and application of 
proceeds therefrom. 
In furtherance thereof, Agent and Borrower hereby agree to exclude the application of paragraph.

Agent of other forms of interim relief.
