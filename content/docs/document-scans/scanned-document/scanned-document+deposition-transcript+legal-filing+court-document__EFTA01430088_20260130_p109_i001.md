Schedule of Realized Gains and Losses Current Period (continued) 
When you report your cost basis on your tax return, it should be verified 
using all of your own records. In particular, there may be other adjustments 
which you need to make, but are not 
required to be made by Pershing as it relates to H.R. 1424. You should 
consult with your tax advisor in order to properly report your gain or loss 
for tax purposes. Pershing shall not be 
responsible for and makes no representations or warranties with respect to 
the accuracy of any information that you report to the IRS or other taxing 
authorities, and, accordingly, disclaims 
any and all liability that may arise with respect to your use and reliance 
on the information provided herein for such reporting. 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities may be adjusted for amortization, 
accretion, original issue discount adjustments, or principal paydowns. The 
calculation is based upon the taxpayer 
election, type of fixed income security, and certain attributes, obtained 
from sources believed to be reliable. In the event, one or more of these 
attributes is changed, there may be a temporary 
incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the cost basis system is 
amended to reflect this change. These calculations will not be performed 
under certain circumstances, including those 
involving foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with less than one 
year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and you 
should consult your tax advisor in the 
preparation of your tax returns. 
1 The cost basis of this security has been provided to us by you or your 
introducing firm and Pershing makes no representation as to the accuracy of 
this information. 
R Reportable Income - This adjustment is the deferred market discount on a 
disposed tax lot from the Original Settle Date. 
Please refer to the Your Account Information Section in your brokerage 
account statement for your account's existing tax-lot disposition method. 
The disposition method is the method which 
you have selected to use in the disposal of each tax lot of the securities 
held in your account. If you do not select a method, your account will be 
defaulted to First In, First Out (FIFO). Your 
account's selected tax lot method will be used to determine the cost basis 
for calculating gain and/or loss, unless another method was selected at the 
time of the security disposal, and this may 
be reported on the IRS Form 1099-B.

Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your 
investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a 
money market mutual fund. Shares 
of a money market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held 
in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds 
credited to your brokerage 
account. Please see the money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank 
deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional
