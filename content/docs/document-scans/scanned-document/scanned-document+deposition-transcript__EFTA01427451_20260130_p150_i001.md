packaging and to focus on the actual ingredients in the food they were 
feeding their pets. Tapping into this unmet consumer demand, the Bishops 
started Blue Buffalo to develop and market pet foods made with the kind of 
ingredients they would want to feed their own furry family members. 
We set up our first offices in a barn in Wilton, Connecticut. Early in 2003, 
PetSmart agreed to sell our products in a 240 store test, and we 
started shipping to them in August of that year. Supported by our Pet 
Detectives, our brand started taking off in 2004, and in the summer of 2006, 
PetSmart started selling BLUE in all of its stores. Since then we have 
continued to add more retail partners to the Buff family as awareness of the 
BLUE brand increased. 
Our business was initially funded by investments from the Bishop family and 
a small number of their friends. In 2006, when BLUE's 
growth potential became clear, we decided to partner with Invus, a private 
investment firm based in New York City, who shared our long-term 
vision for the Company and possessed the deep financial resources required 
for us to realize our full potential. Starting in 2007, we set out on a 
course to achieve leadership in the Wholesome Natural market segment by 
investing in our people and brand building at a level that the scale of our 
business alone could not afford. We recruited seasoned executives from some 
of the largest and most successful companies in the United States and 
invested heavily in both advertising and in-store education. These strategic 
investments in our business required the Bishop family and Invus to 
continue to make significant equity investments to fund our business through 
2009. We turned profitable in 2010, and the BLUE brand exceeded $1 
billion in sales at retail in 2013. Today, BLUE is the leader in the 
Wholesome Natural market segment in the United States and one of the top pet 
food brands overall. We are proud to employ approximately 1,700 full-time 
and part-time Herd members in the United States. 
Evoking the Bishop family's love for their dog "Blue" and the buffalo, an 
iconic image of the natural American frontier, the Blue Buffalo 
name is a constant reminder of our challenge and commitment to "stay true to 
BLUE" and preserve our passion and authenticity as we grow our 
business. As part of our commitment to "stay true to BLUE," we established 
and continue to support the Blue Buffalo Foundation for Cancer 
Research, which sponsors critical studies of pet cancer, health, treatment 
and nutrition at top veterinary medical schools across the United States. 
The most recent study the foundation has funded, and one which we are 
particularly excited about, is a study that may help advance treatments for 
a type of bone cancer that affects both dogs and children. We believe we are 
now the #1 supporter of pet cancer awareness and research in the 
United States, which is a fitting tribute to the family member who inspired 
everything we do, our boy Blue. 
We will remain committed and stay true to our founding objectives of making 
the healthiest pet food we can, being a great place to work 
and helping to find a cure for pet cancer. That is our promise to our loyal 
pet parents and to ourselves.
