Tabk of Contents 
percent (5%) beneficial interest in the company, (3) an immediate family member of any of the foregoing individuals or entities identified 
in (1) or (2) of this paragraph, and (4) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing individuals or entities is employed 
or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person or entity has a five percent (5%) or greater beneficial 
interest. Immediate family members (each, a "Family Member') includes a person's spouse, parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, 
siblings, mothers- and fathers- in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone residing in such person's 
home, other than a tenant or employee. 
Prior to the company entering into any Related Party Transaction, such Related Party Transaction will be reported to our General 
Counsel who will report the same to the audit and risk committee. Our General Counsel will conduct an investigation and evaluation of 
the Related Party Transaction and will report his or her findings to the audit and risk committee, including a summary of material facts. 
The audit and risk committee will review the material facts of all Related Party Transactions which require the audit and risk committee's 
approval and either approve or disapprove of the Related Party Transaction, subject to the exceptions described below. If advance 
notice of a Related Party Transaction has been given to the audit and risk committee and it is not possible to convene a meeting of the 
audit and risk committee, then the chairman of the audit and risk committee will consider whether the Related Party Transaction is 
appropriate and, if it is, will approve the Related Party Transaction, with the audit and risk committee being asked to ratify the Related 
Party Transaction at the next regularly-scheduled meeting of the audit and risk committee. In the event the audit and risk committee does 
not ratify any such Related Party Transaction, management shall make all reasonable efforts to cancel or annul such Related Party 
Transaction. In determining whether to approve or ratify a Related Party Transaction, the audit and risk committee, or its chairman, as 
applicable, will consider all factors it deems appropriate, including the factors listed below in "—Review Criteria." 
Entering into a Related Party Transaction without the approval or ratification required by the terms of the Related Party Policy is 
prohibited and a violation of such policy. In the event the company's directors, executive officers or Chief Accounting Officer become 
aware of a Related Party Transaction that was not previously approved or ratified under the Related Party Policy, such person will 
promptly notify the audit and risk committee and its chairman (or, if it is not practicable for the company to wait for the audit and risk 
committee to consider the matter, the chairman of the audit and risk committee) will consider whether the Related Party Transaction 
should be ratified or rescinded or other action should be taken, with such review considering all of the relevant facts and circumstances 
regarding the Related Party Transaction, including the factors listed below in "—Review Criteria: The chairman of the audit and risk 
committee will report to the committee at its next regularly-scheduled meeting any actions taken under the Related Party Policy pursuant 
to the authority delegated in this paragraph. The audit and risk committee will also review all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to 
the failure to report the Related Party Transaction to the audit and risk committee and will take, or recommend to our board of directors, 
any action the audit and risk committee deems appropriate. 
No member of the audit and risk committee or director of our board will participate in any discussion or approval of a Related Party 
Transaction for which he or she is a Related Party, except that the audit and risk committee member or board director will provide all 
material information concerning the Related Party Transaction to the audit and risk committee. 
If a Related Party Transaction will be ongoing, the audit and risk committee may establish guidelines for the company's 
management to follow in its ongoing dealings with the Related Party. Thereafter, the audit and risk committee, on at least an annual 
basis, will review and assess ongoing relationships with the Related Party to ensure that they are in compliance with the audit and risk 
committee's guidelines and that the Related Party Transaction remains appropriate.
