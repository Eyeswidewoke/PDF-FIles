Event of Default under this Agreement: 
(a) 
Failure to Pay. If Borrower shall fail to pay, when due, any amount owed by it to 
Lender whether hereunder, under the Facility A Note or the Facility B Note, or under any other 
instrument or agreement executed and delivered by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, and 
such amount shall remain unpaid more than three (3) days after such payment is due. 
• 
(b) 
Failure to Maintain Insurance. Borrower shall fail to maintain insurance coverage 
as required by this Agreement, any Security Agreement or the Notes. 
(c) 
Breach of Covenant. If Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any other 
covenant (including but not limited to the covenants set forth in Section 6 hereof), or term to be 
performed or observed by it hereunder, under the Facility A Note or the Facility B Note, or under 
any other instrument or agreement entered into between Borrower and Lender pursuant to this 
Agreement, or furnished by Borrower to Lender pursuant to this Agreement, except any 
covenant or term described in Sections 11(a) or 11(b), and such failure shall not have been 
corrected within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to Borrower by Lender that 
such failure is to be remedied. 
(d) 
Breach of Representation or Warranty. Any warranty, representation or statement 
made by Borrower hereunder or under any other instrument or agreement entered into between 
Borrower and Lender is false or misleading in any material respect when made. 
(e) 
Outside Default Borrower is declared in default, and any grace period applicable 
to such default shall have expired (i) under any contract or obligation for borrowed money 
having an outstanding principal amount of or requiring the payment of money in an amount 
greater than $1,000,000; (ii) under any contract or obligation for borrowed money having an 
outstanding principal amount of or requiring the payment of money in an amount greater than 
$250,000 as to which any other party to such contract or obligation accelerates the indebtedness 
evidenced by such contract (if any), forecloses on property of Borrower, or prevails in an 
enforcement action against Borrower or its property in preparation for a levy on Borrower's 
property; (iii) under any contract or obligation not for borrowed money in which amounts in 
excess of $1,000,000 are in default (in the absence of default by the other party), other than such 
a contract or obligation entered into by and between Borrower and Lender or any parent, 
subsidiary, or Affiliate of Lender (other than Borrower); or (iv) under any aircraft purchase or 
supply agreement by and between Borrower and Lender or any parent, subsidiary, or Affiliate of 
Lender (other than Borrower), in which amounts in excess of $1,000,000 are in default (in the 
absence of default by the other party thereto), provided that the sole remedy for a default with 
respect to an aircraft purchase or supply agreement is for Lender to refuse to extend any further 
credit to Borrower hereunder and provided further that Lender's right to refuse to extend any 
further credit shall be contingent on Lender providing fifteen (15) days prior notice and 
opportunity to cure to Borrower, which opportunity to cure shall include discussions between 
Borrower's Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Raytheon Company to 
determine if the default under such aircraft purchase or supply agreement can be remedied 
without Lender refusing further extensions of credit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in the foregoing, any default referenced in Schedule 6.8(b) to the IRA (as hereinafter
