FX Forecasts and Valuations: Don't throw in the towel 
RMB devaluation and ongoing weakness in China's economy has also again energized the debate about whether the peg 
is suitable for the Hong Kong monetary and financial system. We however, remain of the view that the peg will stay in 
place for foreseeable future, and that re-pegging HKD to a basket of currencies, such as Singapore's FX system, or to the 
RMB are not viable options for the foreseeable future. 
India 
India remains an EM adjustment role model with big strides in C/A improvement, reserve accumulation, and real rates. 
RBI has kept the door open to further easing. FDI trends are constructive. INR should be comparatively less exposed to 
China contagion. The main risks come from domestic disappointments, should there be 'under-delivery' on anticipated 
reforms and/or poor performance in state elections, given offshore positioning in the asset markets remains large. 
Indonesia 
A stubborn current account deficit, large foreign liabilities and limited policy space leave the IDR biased towards more 
weakness. Arguably, Bank Indonesia is already running a relatively tight policy, resisting the temptation to cut rates in the 
face of slower growth, but the appetite to raise rates from here will be more questionable. With recent drawdowns in 
reserves raising the question of adequacy again, policymakers appear to be broadening their tool-kit: USD deposit 
mobilization from banks, macroprudential measures mandating use of IDR, and reductions in domestic individuals' 
outflow limits. We think IDR will continue to slip lower in the weeks ahead. 
Korea 
We think the KRW has more room to weaken in response to the shifts in Chinese FX policy, given the high beta to the 
RMB and related competitiveness concerns. The poor domestic outlook in Korea should also bias policymakers to more 
actively seek a weaker currency and looser monetary conditions. Over the past few months, the authorities have been 
actively introducing policies to recycle the current account surplus. For example, the National Pension Service (NPS) has 
announced that it will accelerate overseas investments, amounting to an additional $32bn of outflows by the end of 2016. 
YTD capital outflows have been around $52bn, compared with a current account surplus of $61bn. More aggressive 
recycling of the surplus could thus help tip Korea's balance of payments towards deficit. Given our house view that the 
Fed will likely raise rates this year, portfolio outflows could accelerate putting more upside pressure on USD/KRW. It is 
worth noting that during the last Fed hike cycle (2004.2006), Korea experienced $17.3bn of equity outflows. 
Malaysia 
We are negative on the MYR, and long short-dated USD forwards with a near-term spot target of 4.50. First, we continue 
to be concerned about the risk of outflows from the bond maturities ahead. Second, we believe official participation 
skews the risk-reward towards USD longs. The central bank appears to have stepped away from its defense of the 
currency in August, with Governor Zeti stating that they are now looking to rebuild reserves. Indeed, reserve holdings 
have risen slightly since then. We thus expect the currency to be supported on dips. Third, an environment in which the 
Fed too is worried about Chinese and EM growth risks cannot be constructive for commodity prices, to which Malaysia 
remains vulnerable. Fourth, politics remains increasingly noisy with opposing domestic protest rallies and international 
investigations. The main source of caution comes from the fact that the MYR does appear undervalued on a few valuation 
models (BEER, PPP) and very stretched when compared to related financial asset prices. Illiquidity adds to the risk of 
gappy price action in spot both down and up. Policy space from reserves or rate hikes we think remains constrained, but 
the main risk of official support could come from large-scale repatriation of government-linked overseas assets. 
Philippines 
Except for the beta to US Treasury moves, there seems less to be worried about in the peso markets for now. The 
inflation trajectory is very well behaved, with core at 1.6%, and headline at 0.6%, well inside of the central bank's target 
zone. Philippines has less to worry about in terms of capital outflows compared with its peers. And its external accounts 
remain healthy as before. on the back of remittance and BoP flows. though export growth has been disappointing like in 
rest of the region. We have been worried about the overvaluation of the currency, but the flow dynamics are supportive. 
Potential idiosyncratic sources of risk, though likely only next year, for peso assets could be if the El Nino conditions turn 
particularly adverse, or if the Presidential elections were to throw up a market unfriendly surprise.
