invent theories. 
Death in Perugia 
On the night of November 1st 2007, Meredith Kercher, a 21 year old =xchange student from south London, was 
murdered in a cottage on the =ia della Pergola in the ancient university city of Perugia in Umbria, =taly. Her body was 
found by police the next day locked in her ground =loor bedroom, covered in a blood-soaked quilt. She had deep stab 
=ounds in her neck. The only clothing on the body was a shirt pulled up =o her neck. Bruises indicated she had been 
held down, and male DNA in =er body indicated she was possibly raped. The exact time of death =ould not be 
determined because the coroner had not been allowed to =mmediately take the body temperature. The autopsy could 
only =stablish a time frame, between 8:55 pm and 12:50 AM. There was also =vidence of a burglary, since housekeys, 
money, cell phones, and =redit cards were missing, and a ten-pound rock had been thrown through =he window of the 
adjoining room. When the crime scene was further =rocessed, finger prints, palm prints, and semen was found that did 
not =atch any of the residents of the cottage. They was also a footprint =f a Nike sneaker in the blood. Two witnesses 
had also seen a young =lack man running down Via della Pergola from the direction of the =ottage at 10:30 PM. They 
said he nearly collided with them. 
The black man seen running away might have been sought as a =uspect if the investigators from the police's "flying 
squad" =elieve that an outsider had killed Meredith, but, within hours of =inding the body, they concluded that all the 
evidence of burglary, =ncluding the broken window, strewn clothing, and missing belongings, =ad been staged to 
mislead them. For one thing, some of the glass =ragments of the window had landed on top of the clothing on the floor 
=ndicating that the rock had been thrown through the window after not =efore the crime, and probably from inside the 
room. For another thing, =t seemed unlikely that an intruder had climbed the 11.5 foot wall to =nter through the 
window, when he could have broken a lower window for =ntry. They therefore assumed it was an inside job done by 
someone who =ived in the cottage. 
The insider theory narrowed the police investigation down to just =even suspects: four young Italian students who 
rented rooms in the =asement of the house, where they grew Cannabis plants; and Filomena =omanelli , Laura Mezzetti, 
and Amanda Knox, who shared the ground =loor flat with Meredith. Each of the women had a separate bedroom =hich 
could be locked from the outside with a key. As it then turned =ut, it was a holiday week in Italy, and all four of the 
Italian men =ad gone away that weekend to visit their families (and had asked =eredith to water their Cannabis plants.) 
Filomena and Laura, both =egal trainees in their late twenties, were also away and had solid =libis. That left one suspect, 
Amanda, a twenty year old American =tudent from Seattle, who was at the house when the police arrived, =issing her 
boy friend Raffaele Sollecito. She was also stunningly =ttractive. Amanda alibi was her boyfriend Raffaele, whom she 
had met =he previous week at a classical musical recital. She told them that =he had stayed over at the nearby flat of 
Raffaele. According to her, =hey had smoked marijuana, watched a DVD of the French movie Amelia, =nd slept 
together. She claimed she only returned to her apartment =he next morning at 11 AM to change her clothing, and 
noticed blood in =he shower. Even though Raffaele initially backed up her alibi, during =he three days of interrogation, 
he changed his story, now saying =manda had left his apartment at 9 pm to go to the bar, Le Chic, where =he worked, 
and did not return until after midnight. Under intensive =nterrogation where she was threatened with imprisonment, 
and without =eing given a lawyer, she also altered her story, implicating the =atrick Lumumba, the Congo-born owner 
of Le Chic. She now said =atrick had murdered her flat mate. On November 6, police arrested =er, Raffaele and Patrick 
for the murder of Meredith. Even though =manda subsequently retracted her accusation, claiming she had been 
=raumatized by police threats, the theory of the prosecutors was that =he murder proceed from an orgy that got out of 
control. But a =roblem developed when a Swiss professor, who had been at the Le Chic =ar on November 1st, swore
