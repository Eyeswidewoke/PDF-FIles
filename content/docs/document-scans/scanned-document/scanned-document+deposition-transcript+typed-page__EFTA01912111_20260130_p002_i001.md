I also need a lawyer if Bryan is going to set up an competitor like Darin. 
Bryan trick is to tell me over and over people do not like me and will only deal 
with Darin. 
He also tells me my whole office hates me and is walking out in 
January. 
There are no jobs. These kids need jobs. They were the ones who found this new 
girl. They interviewed her with me. The office is all staying. 
Andres, has been with me for 13 years. He controls the lists and is staying. 
Melanie does the PR and Marisa organizes the venues and budgets. They are not 
leaving. 
I am getting a new assistant. The one I have came out of an intern pool and has 
a hot temper and hangs up the phone on me and curses at me...I have stopped the 
cursing...she has little grammar skills...is a very hard worker and a creep. I 
am interviewing a new assistant in Jan. That is an easy job to fill. 
Frankly, the office was happy to see Darin go. His moodiness and secrecy caused 
tension in the office...a bright new girl their age with leadership abilities and 
a feeling of team work is what they want. 
Bryan also tells me I was not helpful on Darin's accounts getting high profile 
hosts or high profile friends to come to his events...when I was over loaded with 
my own. 
So Bryan's tactics are...to tell me I am not like by the people who hire us, not 
liked by the office, not helpful on other projects, not interested in new film 
makers....do you get the mentality of putting me down to control me...it's a joke 
when he is a recluse and never has any face time with any of the players...he 
operates on second hand info. 
I do think Bryan was stunned by how much money I brought in Sept to Jan...and we 
have to get all that info asap. 
I think Bryan basically is loyal to me....but could not help himself when he 
hired an unhappy aging gay kid....and got sucked into Darin's problems. 
We have managed to finally beat this Andrew Safra at his own game. Now we have 
to keep up the aggressive work. I am the one with relationships with every studio 
head, every top film maker and the top media. 
How do I tell Bryan that if he helps Darin at all it's a conflict. I know Bryan 
like a book. He will say one is LA based and one is NYC based. 
The events I did in LA were highly successful and that is a whole new 
territory...I am not handing over to Darin. 
I also told Bryan I want to go to every studio and present these press 
conference/lunches all year...as the Oscar race ones are not expensive and yield 
a lot to coverage. He was actually surprised I thought of that and it's a great 
way for more revenu. 
Packing for St. Berths today. I am sick I am going and paying so much to run 
after rich people who do not care about me. I do have my movies as 
currency...but the social pressure of wondering if Ronald Perleman or Janie 
Buffet is talking to me is a waste of my time. 
I will see Geffen, who arrives on the 29th. Derek Blasberg, who wrote the 
Harper's Bazaar profile is getting me into Dasha Ehukova's New Year's Eve
