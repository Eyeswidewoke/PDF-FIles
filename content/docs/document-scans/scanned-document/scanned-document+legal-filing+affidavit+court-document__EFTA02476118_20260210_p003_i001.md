took extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you ov=r a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my very 
close friend.), u=fortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future,=another barrel will appear of your 
own design ) 
=A01 heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the w=rk that is now required. The art 
partnership has fully answered all =our concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . <=pan style="font-
size:12.8000001907349px"> ( FYI Carlyns art partnership that you ref=renced is similar in only its title. ) You will also 
recall that you=required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as=everyone else's .( my work 
was never to include hours upon hours=of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of co=rse should make clear 
that the 2014 tax year that will c=ose Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I pointed =his very fact out 
to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement =ight out of the box. you said you preferred not. As you said ,= 
have produced results to date, far in excess of eve= my own exalted opinion of my projections. I have devoted a 
monumental amo=nt of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of our agreemen=. I will be fair, I am willing to 
roll in the amount still ou=standing from last year if that helps .. However, As my best s=udent , and my only one, you 
are now capable of doing mo=t, if not all, of the required work yourself. I can put =y whiteboard away when you come 
to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. =hare moments ideas etc.. I am of course always availab=e to guide you as a 
friend if you choose that route . always . It wi=l take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to sp=nd any more 
money on mine . 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 =C2, I leave at 5 am sat morning. 
=C2
