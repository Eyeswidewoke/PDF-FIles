1.1.3.11.1 111'D es, 
RI 008 
832 F.2d 554 
(Cite as: 832 F.2d 554, '558) 
[2] We next examine whether there is a separate 
basis for appellate jurisdiction in this case. As we 
have already indicated, orders denying motions to 
quash grand jury subpoenas are ordinarily not 
appealable final orders under section 1291. 
The 
subpoenaed party can obtain review by refusing to 
comply with the subpoena and then contesting a 
contempt citation, which is immediately appealable. 
See United Stares V. Ryan. 402 U.S. 530, 532-33, 
91 S.Q. 1580, 1582, 29 L.Ed.2d 85 (1971). The 
contempt route for obtaining review, however, is 
not open to a third party who claims a privilege of 
nondisclosure with respect to materials in the 
custody of the subpoenaed parry. 
In such a case, 
the putative privilege-holder has no power to 
compel the subpoenaed party to incur a contempt 
citation. 
And the subpoenaed party, unless he has 
either a particularly close relationship to the putative 
privilege-holder 
or 
a 
personal 
interest 
in 
nondisclosure of the material, is unlikely to risk a 
contempt citation simply to vindicate the rights of 
the third parry. In this situation, the order denying 
the motion to quash is indeed final with respect to 
the putative privilege-holder, for any prejudice he 
suffers as a result of disclosure will remain forever 
unredressed unless appeal is permitted. 
Accordingly, this circuit follows the so-called 
Perlman exception to the general rule prohibiting 
interlocutory appeal of orders denying motions to 
quash grand jury subpoenas. See In re Grand Jury 
Proceedings (Twist), 689 F.2d 1351 (11th Cir.1982) 
; In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Fine), 641 F.2d 
199 (5th Cir. Unit A Mar. 1981); 
cf. 
In re 
International Horizons, Inc., 689 F.2d 996 (11th 
• Cir.1982) 
(discovery 
order 
in 
bankruptcy 
proceedings). 
This exception, derived from 
Perlman v. United Stares. 247 U.S. 7, 38 S.Ct. 
417, 62 L.Ed. 950 (1918), and confirmed in United 
States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 691, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 
3099, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), permits an order 
denying a motion to quash to be 'considered final as 
to the injured third party who is otherwise 
powerless to prevent the revelation.' Fine, 641 
P.2d at 202. 
[3] The circumstances supporting application of the 
Perlman exception are present in this case. 
Relying on the Florida grand jury secrecy 
requirement, appellants in essence assert a privilege 
of nondisclosure. 
The material with respect to 
which they assert the privilege—transcripts of their 
state grand jury testimony—is in the custody of the 
Page 4 
State Attorney. 
The State Attorney has indicated 
his intention to produce the transcripts. In light of 
these circumstances, the order denying the motion 
to quash is a final order as far as appellants are 
concerned. 
We therefore have jurisdiction to hear 
their appeal. IFN3) 
F143. We note that the only material sought from 
the subpoenaed party in this ease is material that 
falls squarely within the privilege asserted by the 
third parties. 
This is not a case, then, where a 
party has been subpoenaed to testify or produce 
records and a third party merely fears that 
privileged material may be disclosed along with 
other, noaprivilegcd material. 
In the laner 
situation, the case is nor ripe for appellate review 
until the subpoenaed party has actually been asked 
to reveal specific material covered by the asserted 
privilege. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Doe 
). 831 F.2d 222 (11th Cir.1987). 
Ill. 
In deciding that the narrow Perlman exception 
applies in this case, we have also necessarily 
defined the scope of the matters properly before us 
for review. 
Appellants raise several objections to 
disclosure, including procedural objections and 
objections based on comity considerations and the 
need to protect 'that 
jury system. 
However, the only matter that the 
Perlman exception gives us jurisdiction to review is 
the appellants 
claim_ o 
to prevent 
disclosure of their state grand jury testimony. 
*559 The rationale of the Perlman exception 
extends only to appeals based on privileges personal 
to the third party seeking review: if the subpoenaed 
party has a direct or primary interest in the right or 
privilege in question, the concerns giving rise to the 
Perlman exception simply are not present. 
Here, 
to the extent that their objections to disclosure are 
based .on concerns relating to comity and the 
integrity of the Florida grand jury, appellants 
cannot argue that the subpoenaed party had no 
interest in seeking to vindicate their derivative 
rights. 
Indeed, the subpoenaed party--the State of 
FloridLas_r_qicesented-lay-the-State-Artorney— had 
as its p...

g
d.
ction of its ran 
jurLiystern. Accordingly, the Perlman exception 
does not give us jurisdiction to review the 
appellants' arguments concerning comity and the 
need to preserve the integrity of the Florida grand 
jury. (P144] 
Nor does it give us jurisdiction to 
review their procedural arguments. 
Thus, we do 
not pass upon the district court's disposition of
