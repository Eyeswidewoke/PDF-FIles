laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, accordingly. may not be reoffered. resold, pledged or 
otherwise transferred except in accordance with the restrictions set forth in the Indenture and described under 
"Notices to Purchasers" and below. 
Without limiting the foregoing. by holding a Security. each Holder of Securities will acknowledge and 
agree. among other things, that such Holder of Securities understands that neither of the Co-Issuers is registered as 
an investment company under the Investment Company Act, but that the Issuer claims exemption from registration 
under the Investment Company Act. In this regard. the offering of the Securities has been structured to comply with 
Section 3(e)(7) of the Investment Company Act, which exempts those non-U.S. issuers (i) whose investors residing 
in the United States arc Qualified Purchasers (or Knowledgeable Employees) and (ii) which do not make a public 
offering of their securities in the United States. In general terms. Qualified Purchaser is defined to mean, among 
other things, (i) natural persons who own not less than U.S. $5.000,000 in "investments"; (ii) a company that owns 
not less than U.S. $5,000,000 in "investments" and that is owned directly or indirectly by or for two or more natural 
persons who are related as siblings or spouses (including former spouses). or direct lineal descendants by birth or 
adoption spouses of such persons. the estates of such persons, or foundations. chartable organizations, or trusts 
established by or for the benefit of such persons; (iii) certain trusts that were not formed for the specific purposes of 
acquiring the securities offered, as to which the trustee or other person authorized to make decisions with respect to 
the trust, and each settlor or other person who has contributed assets to the trust, is a qualified purchaser (other than 
certain trusts); and (iv) any person, acting for its own account or the accounts of other qualified purchasers, who in 
the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis, not less than U.S. 525.000.000 in "investments." For 
purposes of the definition of "qualified purchaser," "investments" has the meaning given such term in Rule 2a51-1 
under the Investment Company Act. See "Risk Factors—Other Investment Company Act Considerations."
