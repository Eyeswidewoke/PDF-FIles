RIN II • 094 Alpha Group Capital LLC 
adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission do not apply to collateral managers of CLOs that purchase loans 
in the open market on behalf of its investors because these collateral managers do not qualify as "securitizers" as defined in 
the applicable statutory provision. If the court's decision is determined to be final and non-appealable, the U.S. Risk 
Retention Regulations will no longer apply to collateral managers of open-market collateralized loan obligation transactions 
such as this one and, consequently, the Portfolio Advisor and/or the Retention Holder may transfer some or all of the U.S 
Retention Interest to third parties. 
None of the Transaction Parties, the Retention Holder or their respective affiliates, corporate officers or professional 
advisors or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that the Portfolio Advisor, the Retention 
Holder, their respective affiliates or the transaction contemplated by this Private Placement Memorandum will be in 
compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Regulations. 
See Section 14, "Certain Legal—ERISA and Tax Matters—US Credit Risk Retention." 
European Risk Retention Rules 
The EU Risk Retention Rules or Similar Requirements apply to Affected Investors investing in the Preferred Shares. 
Affected Investors should therefore make themselves aware of the requirements of the EU Risk Retention Rules or 
applicable Similar Requirements (and any implementing rules in relation to a relevant jurisdiction) in addition to any other 
regulatory requirements applicable to them with respect to their investment in the Preferred Shares. Each Affected Investor 
should consult with its own legal, accounting, regulatory and other advisors and/or its regulator to determine whether, and to 
what extent, the information in any investor report provided in relation to the transaction is sufficient for the purpose of 
satisfying the EU Risk Retention Rules or Similar Requirements or any other applicable requirements. Affected Investors are 
required to independently assess and determine the sufficiency of such information. None of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the 
Portfolio Advisor, the Retention Holder, the Placement Agents, the Security Party, the Portfolio Administrator, their 
respective affiliates or any other Person makes any representation, warranty or guarantee that any such information is 
sufficient for such purpose or that the structure of the Preferred Shares and the transactions described herein are compliant 
with the requirements of the EU Risk Retention Rules or Similar Requirements and no such Person shall have any liability to 
any prospective investor or any other Person with respect to the insufficiency of such information or any failure of the 
transactions contemplated hereby to comply with or otherwise satisfy the requirements of the EU Risk Retention Rules or 
Similar Requirements or any other applicable legal, regulatory or other requirements. In the event that a regulator 
determines that the transaction did not comply or is no longer in compliance with the EU Risk Retention Rules or Similar 
Requirements, then if you are an Affected Investor you may be required by your regulator to set aside additional capital 
against your investment in the Preferred Shares. See Section 14, "Certain Legal, ERISA and Tax Matters—European Risk 
Retention." 
RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER 
No Operating History 
The Issuer is a newly formed entity and has no operating history. The Issuer is subject to many of the business risks and 
uncertainties associated with any investment fund with a limited operating history, including the risk that the Issuer will not 
achieve its investment objective. While the types of Collateral Obligations being acquired by the Issuer are subject to a 
number of investment criteria, investment guidelines and conditions, and the Portfolio Advisor is experienced, the Issuer's 
strategy is somewhat novel and untested in the U.S. markets. While the Portfolio Advisor's key principals have extensive 
experience in originating, structuring, monitoring and disposing of loans and other debt instruments comprising the type of 
Collateral Obligations in which the Issuer is investing, there can be no assurance as to the actual accumulation of such 
investments or of the success of such investments. Because the Refinancing documentation will subject the Issuer to
