description of the plane without seeing that it is the plane that holds their descriptions. . . . All who are concerned about the 
violence committed in the name of language will appreciate the useful uselessness of BrockmanaTMs un-book. 
Von FoersteraTMs appreciation of BrockmanaTMs writing is not a surprise. While Brockman began writing his trilogy in 1966, 
von Foerster led a movement that began in 1968 to develop ace2nd order cybemetics,a or ficethe cybernetics of cybemetics.a 
Von Foerster wrote in 1973: 
a brain is required to write a theory of a brain. From this follows that a theory of the brain, that has any aspirations for 
completeness, has to account for the writing of this theory. And even more fascinating, the writer of this theory has to 
account for her or himself. 
That year Bateson and Mead increasingly talked about patterns and processes, or acethe pattern that connects.a They called 
for a new kind of systems ecology in which organisms and the environment in which they live, or which they study, are one in 
the same. They were henceforth to be considered as a single circuit. 
aoelt was only after Afterwards was published in early 1973 that i met Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead, and Heinz von 
Foerster,a remarked Brockman. 
In April of that year, a group that included von Foerster, Bateson, Zen philosopher Alan Watts, and dolphin researcher John 
Lilly convened the legendary AUM (ficeAmerican University of Mastersa) Conference in Big Sur to study G. Spencer Browne 
TMs book Laws of Form. The premise of the aceAmerican University of Mastersa was that it was comprised of those maverick 
intellectuals whose authority derived from their persona, ideas and work, and not from their institutional affiliations. 
Brockman, on the strength of his trilogy, was summoned at the last minute to replace the keynote speaker Richard Feynman, 
who had been hospitalized. 
Later, in New York, on a visit to Brockman in New York, Bateson told him, ficeThe cybernetic idea is the most important 
idea since Jesus Christ. And itaTMs an idea thataTMs foreign to almost every so-called intellectual among mainstream 
thinkers.fi However, it was an idea that was pervading the art world at this time. John Cage, for example, was interested in 
how ideas and patterns move through cultures, while Nam June PaikaTMs videos were, in BrockmanaTMs words, Ocean 
example of the cybernetic idea in action.fi ficeThe cybernetic idea was not about aaâTM and ab,aTMa he recalled. kelt was 
about a process and the process was the reality.a Each of his books is made as a process, performance, or experience, 
recalling the Duchampian idea that the reader/viewer does at least fifty percent of the work. Brockman takes this idea even 
further in his belief that the reader owns the words, which makes his books highly performative in the moment of reading. 
In this, his writing anticipated the ideas of Bateson and Mead concerning the necessity of considering the ecological nature of 
the organism and its environment as a single circuit. Brockman calls it ficeundifferentiated activity.a ficeThe entire work is 
performance piece that in all parts are the whole, undifferentiated as activity, where you canaTMt tell who the subject is, you 
canaTMt tell what the subject is.fi To him, the writing is demanding, physical, and exhausting, requiring constantly keeping in 
mind the complete work, i.e., the single circuit. 
In the first edition of By The Late John Brockman, it is not only the content that is highly experimental, but also its format 
and layout. Each page contains a single paragraph comprised partly of quotes from works by figures from Marshall McLuhan 
to Ludwig Wittgenstein, Samuel Beckett and E. E. Cummings, that is disconnected from its predecessor. A front-page review 
in the San Francisco Review of Books stated: 
In short, sharp strokes of words, he breaks through the very forest of meaning by denying meaning, eschewing traditional 
forms of activities, thoughts and emotions. It is not what he says that is so valuable; it is his whole manner of negating what 
can be said. His words backtrack on themselves, stalk their own meanings, and thrash about in the underbrush of our 
sensibilities. There is a total devastation of language, isolating and withering the very hands our dreams arc made of. 
Preempting the ebook by many decadestror conversely, recalling ancient scrollsirthe first edition was printed on one side of 
the page only. Brockman had told his editor at Macmillan: acelt is obscene to print on both sides of a page.fi 
Although the reception to Afterwards in 1973 was decidedly mixed, comments when it was nominated for the long list of ten 
books for the National Book Award, ranged from ficeTrashiest specimen of newly proliferating genre of electronic dadaa 
(Kirkus), to ficeThe best book since WittgensteinATMs Tractatusa (Alan Watts); from ficeTerrifying 
. depressing . . . cerebral 
. . . icyfi (Vogue), to aceThere are certain writers whose thought is so important that it doesnamt matter whether you agree
