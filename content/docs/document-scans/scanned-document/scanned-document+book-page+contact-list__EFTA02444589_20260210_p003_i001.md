Sustainability and Energy 
believe that a hydrogen economy that used 
electrolysis to generate H2 and O2 from water. 
and a fuel cell to convert H2 and Q back to 
water and electrom, could make a substantial 
contribution to global energy without a much-
improved oxygen electrode. The identification 
of this problem is not in any sense new: The 
redox chemistry of oxygen has been a subject of 
active interest (but limited success) for decades. 
We simply need new ideas. 
Another mason to work on these big prob-
lems is that they will attract the most talented 
young people. Over the past 30 years, the Na-
tional Institutes of Health has used stable and 
generous support to recruit and build a very 
effective community of biomedical scientists. 
Solving the problems of energy and global 
stewardship will require the same patient, 
flexible, and broadly based investment, if 
society believes that the problems in these area 
arc sufficiently important to provide a life's 
work for its most talenteel young people.

PERSPECTIVE 
Toward Cost-Effective 
Solar Energy Use 
Nathan 5. Lewis 
At present, solar energy conversion technologies face cost and scalability hurdles in the 
technologies required for a complete energy system. To provide a truly widespread primary energy 
source, solar energy must be captured, converted, and stored in a cost-effective fashion. New 
developments in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and the materials and physical sciences may 
enable step-change approaches to cost-effective, globally scalable systems for solar energy use. 
m
ore energy from sunlight strikes Earth 
in I hour than all of the energy con-
sumed by humans in an entire year. In 
f ct, the solar energy resource dwarfs all other 
renewable and fossil-based energy resources 
combined (I). With increasing attention to-
ward carbon-neutral energy production, solar 
electricity—or photovoltaic (PV) technology—is 
receiving heightened attention as a potentially 
widespread approach to sustainable energy pro-
duction. The global solar electricity market is 
currently more than S I 0 billion/year. and the in-
dustry is growing at more than 30% per annum 
(2). However, low-cost, base-loadable. fossil-
based electricity has always served as a for-
midable cost competitor for electrical power 
generation. To provide a truly widespread primary 
energy source, solar energy must be captured, 
convened, and stored in a cast-effective fashion. 
Even a solar electricity device that operated at 
near the theoretical limit of 70% efficiency would 
not provide the needed technology if it were 
expensive and if there were no cost-effective 
mechanism to store and dispatch the converted

solar energy upon demand (3). Hence, a com-
plete solar-basal energy system will not only 
require cost reduction in existing IN manufac-
turing methods, but will also requite science and 
technology breakthroughs to enable, in a conve-
nient, scalably manufacturablc tom . the ultralow-
cost capture, onwasion, and storage of sunlight. 
One key step is the capture and conversion 
of the energy contained in solar photons. 
Figure I shows the fully amortized cost of elec-
tricity as a function of the efficiency and cost of 
an installed IN module (2, 4). Because the total 
energy provided by the Sun is fixed over the 30-
year lifetime of a PV module, once the energy 
conversion efficiency of a PV module is estab-
lished, the total amount of "product" electricity 
produced by the module al a representative mid-
latitude location is known for the lifetime of the 
system. The theoretical efficiency limit for even 
an optimal single band gap solar conversion 
device is 31%, because photons having energies 
lower than the absorption threshold of the active 
PV material are not absorbed, whereas photons 
having energies much higher than the band gap 
rapidly release heat to the lattice of the solid and 
therefore ultimately contain only a useful in-
ternal energy equal to that of the band gap (2). 
Small test cells have demonstrated efficiencies 
of >20%. with the remaining losses almost en-
tirely due to small reflection losses, grid shading 
losses• and other losses at the 5 to 10% level that 
any practical system will have to some extent. 
Shipped PV modules now have efficiencies of 
IS to 20% in many cases. At such an efficiency, 
if the cost of a module is —53001m2 (2), and if we 
take into account the accompanying fixed costs 
in the so-called "balance of system" (such as 
the inverter, grid connection, etc., which add a 
factor of -2 to the total installed system cost), 
then the sale price of grid-connected PV elec-
tricity must be 50.25 to 50.30 per kilowatt-hour 
(kWh) to recover the initial capital investment 
and cost of money over the lifetime of the PV 
installation (2. 4). Qurently, however, utility-
scale electrical power generation costs BM much 
less, with current and new installations costing 
-S0.03 to 50.05 per kWh (1). Hence. for solar 
electricity to be cost-competitive with fossil-
based electricity at utility scale, improvements 
in efficiency are helpful, but manufacturing costs 
must be substantially reduced. 
In current manufasiuring schemes for Si-
based solar cells, the cost of the processed and 
purified Si is only about 10% of the final cost of 
the PV module. Some of the Si is lost in cutting 
up boules into wafers, and other costs arc 
incurred in polishing the wafers, making the 
diffused junction in the Si into a photovoltaic 
device, fabricating the conducting transparent 
glass, masking and making the electrical con-
tacts. sealing the cells, connecting the cells 
together reliably into a module, and sealing the 
module for shipment. I knee, in such systems, 
the energy conversion efficiency is at a premium 
so as to bate amortize these other fixed costs 
involved with snaking the final PV module. 
Improvements in efficiency above the 31% 
theoretical limit are possible if the constraints that 
are incorporated into the so-called Shockley-
Qucisser theoretical efficiency limit are relaxed 
(2). For example. if photons having energies 
greater than the band gap of the absorbing 
material did not dissipate their excess energy as 
heat. but instead produced more voltage or
