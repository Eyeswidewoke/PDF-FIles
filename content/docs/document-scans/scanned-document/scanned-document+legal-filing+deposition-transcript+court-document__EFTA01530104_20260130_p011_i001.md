For the Period 11/1/12 to 11/30/12 
For your convenience we have combined statement(s) for activity you conduct 
through J.P. Morgan in one package. Below are important disclosures relating 
to these different accounts. 
These statements may relate to various account types. Some of the 
disclosures are applicable to all of your accounts. For ease of reference 
the disclosures applicable to a particular type 
of account have been grouped together by descriptive headers. 
IMPORTANT GENERAL INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO ALL OF YOUR ACCOUNT(S) 
Important Information about Pricing ,Valuations, Estimated Annual Income, 
and Estimated Yield 
Market value information (including without limitation, prices, exchange 
rates, accrued income and bond ratings) furnished herein, some of which has 
been provided by pricing sources that J.P. Morgan 
believes to be reliable, is not guaranteed for accuracy but provided for 
informational purposes and is furnished for the exclusive use of the client. 
The current price is the value of the financial asset share, unit or 
contract as priced at the close of the market on the last day of the 
statement period or the last available price. All values provided for 
structured yield deposits (for example, JPMorgan London Time Deposits) 
reflect the original deposit amount only. The value for Real Estate, Mineral 
Interests and Miscellaneous Assets may not reflect 
the most current value of the asset. 
Important information regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt 
or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically 
in an auction. Although there may be daily, weekly 
and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If 
there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available 
for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the event 
of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will 
develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected 
on statements and online. Accordingly, investors should not 
rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with 
respect to ARS. When J.P. Morgan is unable to obtain a price from an 
internal or outside source for a particular ARS, the price 
column on your statement will indicate "unpriced". 
Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain 
derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market 
basis. These valuations are sourced from the various 
issuers of the securities or they are sourced from a third party valuation 
provider. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the 
accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the 
valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the 
valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. Valuations are 
provided for information purposes only and are 
intended solely for your own use. Please refer to the trade confirmation for 
details of each transaction. 
Certain assets, including but not limited to, pooled and private 
investments, non-publicly traded and infrequently traded securities, 
derivatives, partnership interests and tangible assets are generally 
illiquid, the value of such asset may have been provided to us by third
