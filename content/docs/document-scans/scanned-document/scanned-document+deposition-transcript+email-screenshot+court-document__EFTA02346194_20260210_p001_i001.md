Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmed Al Jaber Al Sabah<=div>

Reuters=/span> 
This is a visit to pay tribute and to express grat=tude. 
It has not only been the Kuwaiti leadership i= humanitarian action but when I was High Commissioner for Refugees, I 
remem=er how the media of Kuwait presided to the same conferences to mobilize int=rnational community to support 
the Syrian people suffering so much with the=war that has been going on and on. My predecessor Ban Ki-Moon has 
nominated=His Highness as Humanitarian Leader globally. But its not only the humanita=ian leadership of Kuwait: it's 
the wisdom, the dialogue, the promot=on of understanding that Kuwait has been showing in relation to all conflic=s in 
the region and Kuwait has no agenda. The agenda of Kuwait is peace and=understanding. In relation to the recent crisis 
that occurred in the Gulf, t=e position of the United Nations is very simple; we are here to support the=Kuwaiti 
mediation and this was an occasion for me to express our deep appre=iation to say how much we want to strengthen 
the cooperation and the dialog=e between Kuwait and the U.N. as we believe Kuwait is an extremely reliable=partner in 
our common commitment to peace and security around the world. 
We had the opportunity to discuss all the very diffic=lt situations we are facing, not only the Gulf crisis, Yemen, Syria, the 
dr=ma of the Palestinian people, Libya, the need to make sure Iraq is able to c=me together in unity after defeating ISIS. 
So all these aspects were discus=ed in a very detailed way and I had the opportunity, once again, to discuss=my deep 
appreciation for all the initiatives Kuwait has had in relation to t=e solution to this crisis. We also discussed the situation 
in the Gulf and m=ny of the humanitarian objectives that Kuwait has been leading and that we f=lly support. 
We are doing our best to create condi=ions for the present stalemate to be overcome. Kuwait was extremely success=ul 
in the first conference that was made and we will be working very closel= with the Yemen authorities to see when and 
how a new strong initiative for=peace would be possible. 
We are not facing any pre=sure and we conceded that no pressure would lead to anything. But we are no= having any 
pressure, there is technical work being conducted and in the en= that will be presented to me and I will take the decision 
according to wha= I will feel is the right thing to do. 
First of al=, there is an initiative that my special representative is trying to push i= order to create conditions for both 
Hodeidah and Sanaa to allow for an eff=ctive use for humanitarian purposes for these two very important 
infrastruc=ures. I hope that it will be possible for an agreement to be achieved betwe=n the parties to allow for 
Hodeidah and Sanaa to be fully operational for t=e humanitarian needs of the Yemeni people who are suffering in such a 
terri=le way and deserves our solidarity and commitment.
