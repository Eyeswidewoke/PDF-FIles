this prospectus, has not been approved and/or endorsed by us or the

Directed Share Program 
At our request, the underwriters have reserved for sale at the initial 
public offering price up to 5% of the shares offered hereby for our 
directors, officers, certain employees and certain other related parties who 
have expressed an interest in purchasing shares in the offering. The 
number of shares of common stock available for sale to the general public in 
the offering will be reduced to the extent these persons purchase the 
directed shares in the program. Any directed shares not so purchased will be 
offered by the underwriters to the general public on the same terms as 
the other shares. Except for certain participants who have entered into lock-
up agreements as contemplated above, each person buying shares 
through the directed share program has agreed that, for a period of 180 days 
from and including the date of this prospectus, he or she will not, 
without the prior written consent of Jefferies LLC and J.P. Morgan 
Securities LLC, dispose of or hedge any shares of common stock or any 
securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock with 
respect to shares purchased in the program. For those participants who 
have entered into lock-up agreements as contemplated above, the lock-up 
agreements contemplated therein shall govern with respect to their 
purchases of shares of common stock in the program. Jefferies LLC and J.P. 
Morgan Securities LLC in their sole discretion may release any of the 
securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time. We have agreed 
to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities and expenses, 
including liabilities under the Securities Act, in connection with sales of 
the directed shares.
