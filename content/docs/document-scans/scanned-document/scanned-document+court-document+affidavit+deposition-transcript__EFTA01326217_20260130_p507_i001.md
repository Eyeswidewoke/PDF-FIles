Data Shmt Al2EA. 
Refer to: GAC FAA Approved Aircraft Service Change (ASC) Number 231, SUBJECT: ELECTRICAL POWER 
(ATA 24) "E"BlIS ALTERNATE POWER - MODIFICATION: dated JULY 31, 1992. 
The purpose of this change is to provide an shanate source of power to prevent the loss of critical systems in the 
crag an E-Bantry (E-Batt) fails during normal operation. The present design has many systems powered only by 
an E-Batt Should an E-Batt fail dining normal operation all of the systems powered by that batty would be lost. 
This service clusage provides Essential (MS) dc btu power that will save taracanically as an alternate power source 
to the F.-Bases should an &Bait fail dwiiss uorinal operation 
Parfait:Mid all of ASC 231's MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS listed es effective for skald 1001, 1060-1211. 
except for the following deviations: (see Figure 4) Wire Number 1PU9005A14 and 22U9005A14 were not installed; 
ensued two new 10 gauge wires were sump ideotified 1PU9005A10 and 2PU9001A10 god commted as follows: 
wise IPU9005A10 was connected between the Line side of CB2311 tad the line side of ASC231CBI; wire 
2PU900$A10 wan conneved ass shown (Figure 4) u place of 2PU9005Al4. Raychem solder spikes were used to 
mate all three way connections. All instalkd wires that required crimp installation were fitted to the proper size 
contact or teronival. Now: The listed deviations were required to maintain ccaformity with previously approved 
configurations and did not alter the intended function of the approved ASC 231. 
Note. Figure It'Sezedified Schnook Diagram* is no coma Om Figure 3 foe CB idesoenion): ASCDICBI should .

Returned the aircraft to flight status and recorded compliance with this FAA Form 337 in the aircraft's msniteranot

It has bits daermined that the interrelationship between this change sod no  prniubsty approved configuration will 
not introduce any adverse effect icon the airworthiness of the ant 
This determination includes. bust is not limited 
to: The change to the ainnes electrical load analysis data is negligible; When perfonning its intended functions the 
operation is reno.matic; There arc no cbangei to the operational limitations. No 'light manual supplants/ me 
required: and the installation is compatible withaall pinions alterations assuring continuous conformity with the 
applicable airworthiness requirements,
