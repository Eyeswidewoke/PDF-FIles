- Eleven Arrested in Crackdown on Congo's Elephant Poachers I ENS 
10117/16, 2:43 PM 
At 13.500 square kilometers, Odzala-Kokoua is the Congo's largest national park and is located in the second largest rainforest region in the world. 
In addition, the arrests of eight people were initiated by the nonprofit Project for the Application of Law for Fauna, PALF, working with the national 
police, the Gendarmerie Nationale. 
African Parks congratulates the Congolese Ministry of Forest Economy and Sustainable Development, which is responsible for the country's elephant 
protection efforts: the Gendarmerie Nationale: PALF and Odzala-Kokoua's Anti-Poaching Unit on these recent breakthroughs. 
"The growing list of arrests is a testimony to the fact that our combined tactics are delivering results in the fight against elephant poaching in the 
regionT said African Parks CEO Peter Fearnhead. 
In October, two poachers were arrested on the eastern boundary of the park by Odzala's Anti-Poaching Unit. They admitted selling ivory to a Chinese 
national, an employee of the China Road and Bridge Corporation, CRBC. His driver also was arrested. 
The men were found in possession of pieces from three tusks which had been stashed at the CRBC camp at Moyoye. On inspecting the camp, 
Odzala's Anti-Poaching Unit found evidence that the site had been used to cut and shape ivory into artifacts. The two men were charged but released 
on bail and the case is currently before the national prosecutor. 
In November at Yengo control post, southeast of Odzala. a Chinese national was arrested by Odzala's eco-guards after a piece of ivory was found in 
his laptop bag. Traces of ivory were discovered again at the CRBC camp at Moyoye where the Chinese national was based. He was arrested but 
released by the prosecutor based in Ouesso. 
In late November. anti-poaching operations supported by PALF resulted in the arrests of eight people, with more arrests set to follow. 
The operation started with an enormous elephant tusk seized by PALF and a consortium of nongovernmental organizations. while another ivory haul 
from a dealer included a sack full of sculpted ivory. 
On November 30. another dealer with sculpted ivory was arrested, and later that day a Chinese national attempted to board a flight at Maya Maya 
Airport in Brazzaville with a suitcase of ivory after bribing a "fixer" to get it through.

A team of people from the Ministry of Forest Economy and Sustainable Development working with the Departmental Director of the Lusaka 
Agreement Task Force and the Gendarmerie Nationale arrested the Chinese national along with the person who accepted the bribe to facilitate the 
passage of his luggage undetected through customs. 
Before African Parks took on the management of Odzala under the auspices of the Odzala-Kokoua Foundation in 2011, the central area of the park 
had not been patrolled for four years. 
Since then. African Parks has implemented a multi-pronged anti-poaching plan to address threats. A unique amnesty program has seen the 
recruitment and training of 28 former poachers to become eco-guards focused on anti-poaching, as well as 17 former poachers trained as eco-
monitors. 
In May, five applicants to the Odzala Amnesty Programme confessed to previously working with Congolese ivory kingpin. Ngondjo Ghislain, known 
by the nickname Pepito. He was convicted in July and is currently serving a five year prison sentence. 
Elephant poaching is connected to other types of crime and atrocities, says Fcamhcad. "The Lord's Resistance Army is now part of a larger poaching 
crisis that is decimating elephants throughout central Africa," he said. "The high price of ivory is increasingly incentivizing the involvement of armed 
groups such as the LRA, sustaining their atrocities in the region."
