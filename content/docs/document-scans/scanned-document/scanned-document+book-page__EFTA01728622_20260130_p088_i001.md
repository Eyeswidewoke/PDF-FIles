Dost/Wiegand criteria when so many other details concerning its existence 
are available. 
Evaluation Criteria 
The essence of the Dost, Wiegand, Arvin, Cross, and Knox decisions seems to 
correctly be that the material in question must be evaluated in context on a case-
by-case basis. When the totality of facts is known, I have never seen a case where 
there was any doubt whether a visual depiction of a child was simple nudity (i.e., 
innocent family photograph, work of art, medical research, image for sex therapy) 
or lascivious exhibition of the genitals. Those claiming there is a doubt are often 
attempting to cover up sexual exploitation of children by creating a smokescreen 
to confuse the issue. I know of no investigators or prosecutors in the United States 
with so little work that they would use child-pornography laws to try and convict 
true professionals who utilize this material in a professional way or normal par-
ents who simply have photographs of their nude, young children. 
It is inappropriate and wrong for investigators or prosecutors, based only on 
viewing visual images of children's genitals, to state such material is not child 
pornography. It may be appropriate and correct, however, for investigators or 
prosecutors, based only on viewing such images, to state that the material does 
not meet their investigative or prosecutive criteria. 
Assuming it meets the minimum legal criteria, potential child pornogra-
phy must always be evaluated in the total context in which it is discovered, and it 
must be objectively investigated. As previously discussed the evaluation criteria 
for visual images produced by a subject may be different from those for visual 
images received or downloaded by a subject. One subject could have in his collec-
tion both images he produced and images he obtained from others. The problem 
is that while courts sometimes rule that borderline material should be evaluated 
in context, other times they rule that the context material is inadmissible because 
its prejudicial value outweighs its probative value. 
The criteria noted below are offered for the evaluation of such photographs. 
As used' here the term photograph includes any visual depiction such as nega-
tives, prints, slides, movies, videotapes, and digital computer images. The criteria 
can also be used to evaluate child erotica. 
How They Were Produced/Obtained Because photographs are well taken and have 
artistic value or merit does not preclude the possibility that they are sexually 
explicit. Because someone is a professional photographer or artist does not pre-
dude the possibility that he or she has a sexual interest in children. The lascivious 
exhibition of the genital or pubic area is characteristic of the photographer or 
collector, not the child, in order to satisfy his voyeuristic needs and sexual 
interest. 
Pedophiles are more likely to use trickery, bribery, or seduction to take their 
photographs of children. They sometimes photograph children under false pre-
tenses, such as leading them or their parents to believe that modeling or acting 
jobs might result. Some 'offenders even hide and surreptitiously photograph 
children. One pedophile hid above the ceiling of a boys' locker room and 
photographed toys through a moved ceiling tile. Many pedophiles even collect 
photographs of children who are complete strangers to them. They take these 
pictures at swimming meets, wrestling matches, child beauty pageants, parks,
