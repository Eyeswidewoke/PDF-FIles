independence. But in 2005, the Dutch and French both voted no. The Eurocrats then relaunched the constitution as a 
treaty, which allowed parliamentary approval in every member nation other than Ireland, whose constitution required a 
popular vote. But the Irish voted no, again halting the bandwagon. Under EU pressure, the Irish government held 
another poll and won the desired result. 
European officialdom celebrated the new EU but chose two indistinguishable and undistinguished politicians for the new 
positions of president and foreign minister. Then, the euro-zone crisis exploded. The common currency yoked together 
relatively efficient northern European countries with congenitally improvident Mediterranean states. The latter 
attempted to counteract lost competitiveness with increased borrowing. The bill finally came due. 
Greece led the crisis parade, followed by Ireland and Portugal. But true disaster threatened with far-larger Spain and 
Italy—perhaps too big to fail, probably too big to save. The Eurocratic response was always the same: if new problems 
threatened, explained European Council president Herman Van Rompuy, "we'll do more." 
"Doing more" meant borrowing more. The London-based organization Open Europe termed the EU "a de facto debt 
union." However, the increased debt was used to turn the EU into a de facto transfer union as well. Daniel Hannan, a 
British Member of the European Parliament, responded: "It doesn't strike [EU leaders] as eccentric to address a debt 
crisis with more debt." 
Berlin vs. Paris 
Most important, "doing more" meant Germany "doing more." With the continent's largest and most productive 
economy, Berlin had the most to give. And it was expected to do so. 
Chancellor Merkel supported every new cash infusion. But she continued to resist proposals to issue Eurobonds, which 
would turn Germany's financial rating over to its least responsible neighbors. She also rejected proposals to transform 
the European Central Bank into a government lender of last resort, violating its legal charter to purchase whatever 
bonds Berlin's neighbors chose to issue. 
For this, Berlin was assailed for myopic penury. Critics assailed Germany's "new selfishness" and "loss of solidarity." 
Germany was "losing sight of the European common good," exhibiting a "narrow and self-defeating definition of 
national interests" and "impeding all avenues for a solution." All because Berlin refused to turn control of its finances 
over to Brussels. Germany remains willing to pay to save the euro zone, but it wants control over any national budgets 
it underwrites. The Lisbon Treaty expanded continental authority at the price of national sovereignty, allowing Brussels 
to claim greater authority over members' financial decisions. But Lisbon provided no controls over members' budget 
decisions. Chancellor Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy are pushing for more fundamental change. "We 
have a common currency," said Merkel, "but no common political and economic union. And this is exactly what we must 
change. To achieve this—therein lies the opportunity of the crisis." But Merkel and Sarkozy disagreed on the exact 
institutional remedy. She favored an EU-wide treaty; he preferred to center enforcement within the euro zone. Angela 
Merkel appears to have won the debate, though the exact terms are still being debated. But Great Britain and other 
countries may not join. And whatever is cooked up in Brussels may be too late to save Greece. Default is a reality, 
whether officially recognized or tactfully disguised. Athens has yet to implement past promises; the new government to 
be elected by an angry electorate in April will face pressure to renegotiate. European leaders are demanding assurances 
which they cannot enforce. 
When the Music Stops 
Some Eurocrats are willing to risk the euro zone. Former Dutch EU Commissioner Frits Bolkestein argued that separation 
is "unavoidable" since "we constructed something that does not work in the long term." Departure from the euro would 
allow the Greeks to become competitive through devaluation—painful, to be sure, but not obviously worse than years 
of austerity and stagnation to pay off even a reduced debt. Greece could be joined by other struggling states in leaving. 
Or Germany, France and other more prosperous states might give their weaker counterparts a shove. A euro-zone
