Happy holiday 
PAUL Allen, 51, the bachelor Microsoft co-founder worth $20 billion (according to Forbes), rang in the New Year 
with British blonde Kate Reardon, 36 (above), a former fashion director for Taller magazine who now writes 
about jewelry for the Times of London. The couple ushered in 2005 in St. Baits aboard Allen's 413- foot yacht, 
"Octopus," equipped with two helicopters and a 60-foot submarine. There were scores of other guests but Allen 
seemed mesmerized by Reardon, who had a similareffect on another billionaire, Sir Jimmy Goldsmith. Reardon 
attended Goldsmith's funeral in 1997, along with his widow and his second wife. "Conveniently, Allen has a 
house in London," said our source. 
Super at 14 
THE 44 contestants in the Ford Supermodel of the World contest learned evasive maneuvers at the after-party 
at the Tunnel, where they met such studs as Jesse Palmer of the Giants, Trevor Ariza of the Knicks, Jamie 
(Tom Rich") Johnson and Kelly ("The Apprentice") Perdew. New husband Fabian Basabe showed, too, without 
bride Martina Borgomanero, and worked the red carpet. The winner, who also got a $250,000 modeling contract, 
was Brazilian Camila Finn (above), all of 14. She might look even better when she grows up. 
ITS THE TRUMAN CAPOTE SHOW 
TRUMAN Capote, dead for over 20 years, is suddenly a hot property in Hollywood. The author of "Breakfast at 
Tiffany's' and "In Cold Blood" is the subject of two new biopics - Warner Independent's "Every Word Is True," 
based on George Plimpton's 1997 oral history, and United Artists' "Capote," based on the landmark 1988 Gerald 
Clarke biography. "Capote," due out this fall, stars Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who is talented but a bit burly to 
play the "tiny terror." "Every Word" stars relatively unknown Toby Jones with an all-star supporting cast including 
Alan Cumming, Anjelica Huston, Sandra Bullock (as "To Kill a Mockingbird" author Harper Lee), Ashley Judd, 
Kevin Kline, Gwyneth Paltrow and Sigourney Weaver. Hollywood columnist Jeffrey Wells reports that "Capote" 
has the advantage of Hoffman in the starring role, while "Every Word; which just started filming, is said to have 
a much better screenplay. 
Own show 
COURTNEY Fine, a former aide to Mayor Bloomberg who left politics to become an actress, is showcasing "Me 
2; a play she wrote about a woman jailed for breaking into the bar where she left her cell- phone. Among those 
invited to last night's opening at the Producers Club 2: Victoria Gotti, Amy Fine Collins and Bloomberg's sister 
Marjorie Tiven. The show closes after tomorrow's performance. 
Never mind 
GEORGE Pamham, the lawyer for Andrea Yates, is quick to cash in after winning her a new trial for the murder 
of her fwe kids. Pamham, who will try to get Yates off using the insanity defense, is shopping a book, "States of 
Mind," which will focus on his favorite tricks for defending female killers: postpartum depression, premenstrual 
syndrome and post-traumatic stress. And he'll include similar cases: Clara Harris, who allegedly ran over her 
unfaithful husband with herMercedes Benz, and Lisa Montgomery, who strangled Bobbie Jo Stinnett and then 
surgically removed her fetus last month.
