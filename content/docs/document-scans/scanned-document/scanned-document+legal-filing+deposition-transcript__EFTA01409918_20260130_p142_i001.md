MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS 
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial 
condition and results of operations in conjunction with the "Selected 
Historical Consolidated Financial Information" section of this prospectus 
and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing 
elsewhere in this prospectus. In addition to historical information, this 
discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on 
current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such 
as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions set forth in the 
"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" section and included 
elsewhere in this prospectus. Our actual results and the timing of 
events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking 
statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in 
the "Risk Factors" section and included elsewhere in this prospectus. 
We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday that is 
closest to December 31 of that year. Each fiscal year generally is 
comprised of four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 
weeks the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 
2013 and Fiscal 2814 ended on December 30, 2012, December 29, 2013 and 
December 28, 2014, respectively, and each were comprised of 52 
weeks. Fiscal 2015 is a 53-week fiscal year. 
Overview 
Fogo de Chao (fogo-dee-shoun) is a leading Brazilian steakhouse, or 
churrascaria, which has specialized for over 35 years in fire-roasting 
high-quality meats utilizing the centuries-old Southern Brazilian cooking 
technique of churrasco. We deliver a distinctive and authentic Brazilian 
dining experience through the combination of our high-quality Brazilian 
cuisine and our differentiated service model known as espeto corrido 
(Portuguese for "continuous service") delivered by our gaucho chefs. We 
offer our guests a tasting menu of meats featuring up to 20 cuts, simply 
seasoned and carefully fire-roasted to expose their natural flavors. 
Guests can begin their dining experience at the Market Table, which offers a 
wide variety of Brazilian-inspired side dishes, fresh-cut 
vegetables, seasonal salads, aged cheeses and cured meats, or they can 
receive immediate entrée service table-side from our gaucho chefs by 
turning a service medallion, found at each guest's seat, green side up. Each 
gaucho chef rotates throughout the dining room, and is responsible for a 
specific cut of meat which they prepare, cook and serve to our guests 
continuously throughout their meal. Guests can pause the service at any time 
by turning the medallion to red and then back to green when they are ready 
to try additional selections and can communicate to our gauchos their 
preferred cut of meat, temperature and portion size. Our continuous service 
model allows customization and consumer engagement since our guests 
control the variety and quantity of their food and the pace of their dining 
experience. Through the combination of our authentic Brazilian cuisine, 
unique service model, prix fixe menu and engaging hospitality in an upscale 
restaurant atmosphere, we believe our brand delivers a differentiated 
dining experience relative to other specialty and fine-dining concepts and
