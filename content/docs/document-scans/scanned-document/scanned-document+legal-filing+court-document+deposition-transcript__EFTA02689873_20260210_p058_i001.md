Economic risk 
14.5 
Current financial crisis based mostly on credit crunch seriously influenced many of the emerging economies and 
their financial sectors. Numerous emerging economies have at various times been affected by declines in gross 
domestic product, higher inflation, an unstable currency and high corporate indebtedness relative to the Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP). 
14.6 
The economies of the emerging markets that will be targeted by the Compartment are heavily dependent on a few 
segments and markets (such as the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China) and are therefore 
highly sensitive to changes in these segments and indirectly to the economical situation in the Russian 
Federation and the People's Republic of China. 
Transparency 
14.7 
Companies in emerging markets are not always subject to disclosure, accounting, auditing and financial 
standards which are equivalent to those applicable in Western European countries. Available information may 
also be less reliable. There may be less rigorous government supervision and regulation. Regulatory regimes 
relating to foreign investment are still in their infancy in certain emerging countries. This may mean that rules 
are being applied for the first time or are inconsistently being applied. In addition, for companies that keep 
accounting records in local currency, inflation accounting rules may require, for both tax and accounting 
purposes, that certain assets and liabilities be restated on the company's balance sheet in order to express items 
in terms of currency of constant purchasing power. As a result, financial data may be materially affected by 
restatements for inflation and may not accurately reflect the real condition of companies and securities markets. 
Accordingly, the Compartment's ability to conduct due diligence in connection with a proposed investment and 
to monitor an Investment may be adversely affected by these factors. 
Official data 
14.8 
Thc quality and reliability of official data published by governments and government agencies of certain 
emerging countries are generally not equivalent to that of Western countries. 
Accounting practice 
14.9 
Accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards in emerging markets do not always match International 
Financial Reporting Standards and are not always equivalent to those applicable in Western European 
economies. The obligation on the Portfolio Companies to publish financial information is relatively limited, thus 
making satisfactory due diligence prior to any acquisition harder to achieve. 
Foreign currency and exchange rates 
14.10 
The Compartment's assets mostly will be invested in assets denominated in other currency than the EUR, some 
of which are not externally convertible into other currencies. The value of the Compartment's assets, as 
measured in EUR, may be affected, both positively and negatively, by fluctuations in currency rates and 
exchange control regulations. 
Foreign investment restrictions 
14.11 
Thc laws of emerging countries, including taxation on foreign investment, trade of securities and transfer of title 
that are applicable to the Compartment's activities can change in a manner far more volatile than in Western 
countries. The laws of emerging countries may be unclear or contradictory and subject to varying interpretations 
and may at any time be amended, modified, repealed or replaced in a manner materially adverse to the interests 
of the Compartment.
