Options. The Compensation Committee may grant non-qualified stock options 
and incentive stock options, under our 2015 Plan, with 
terms and conditions determined by the Compensation Committee that are not 
inconsistent with our 2015 Plan; provided, that all stock options 
granted under our 2015 Plan are required to have a per share exercise price 
that is not less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock 
underlying such stock options on the date such stock options are granted 
(other than in the case of options that are substitute awards), and all stock 
options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options must be 
granted pursuant to an award agreement expressly stating that the options are 
intended to qualify as an incentive stock options, and will be subject to 
the terms and conditions that comply with the rules as may be prescribed by 
Section 422 of the Code. The maximum term for stock options granted under 
our 2015 Plan will be ten years from the initial date of grant, or with 
respect to any stock options intended to qualify as incentive stock options, 
such shorter period as prescribed by Section 422 of the Code. However, 
if a non-qualified stock option would expire at a time when trading of 
shares of common stock is prohibited by our insider trading policy (or 
"blackout period" imposed by us), the term will automatically be extended to 
the 30th day following the end of such period. The purchase price for 
the shares as to which a stock option is exercised may be paid to us, to the 
extent permitted by law (i) in cash or its equivalent at the time the stock 
option is exercised; (ii) in shares having a fair market value equal to the 
aggregate exercise price for the shares being purchased and satisfying any 
requirements that may be imposed by the Compensation Committee; or (iii) by 
such other method as the Compensation Committee may permit in 
its sole discretion, including, without limitation, (A) in other property 
having a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the purchase 
price, 
(B) if there is a public market for the shares at such time, through the 
delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell the shares being 
acquired upon the exercise of the stock option and to deliver to us the 
amount of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate exercise price for 
the shares being purchased or (C) through a "net exercise" procedure 
effected by withholding the minimum number of shares needed to pay the 
exercise price and all applicable required withholding taxes. Any fractional 
shares of common stock will be settled in cash. 
Stock Appreciation Rights. The Compensation Committee may grant stock 
appreciation rights, with terms and conditions determined by 
the Compensation Committee that are not inconsistent with our 2015 Plan. 
Generally, each stock appreciation right will entitle the participant upon 
exercise to an amount (in cash, shares or a combination of cash and shares, 
as determined by the Compensation Committee) equal to the product of 
(i) the excess of (A) the fair market value on the exercise date of one 
share of common stock, over (B) the strike price per share, times (ii) the 
number of shares of common stock covered by the stock appreciation right. 
The strike price per share of a stock appreciation right will be 
determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant but in no 
event may such amount be less than the fair market value of a share of
