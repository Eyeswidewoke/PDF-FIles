Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa F... Page 9 of 32 
extraordinary in his ability to pick up on quantitative relations," says Edelman. "He came to see us 
recently. He is concerned with this basic question: Is it true that the brain is not a computer? He is very 
quick." 
Then there is Stephen Kosslyn, a psychologist at Harvard. Epstein flew up to Kosslyn's laboratory in 
Cambridge this year to witness an experiment that Kosslyn was conducting and Epstein was funding. 
Namely: Is it true that certain Tibetan monks are capable of holding a distinct mental image in their 
minds for twenty minutes straight? "We disproved the thesis," says Kosslyn. "Jeff was on his cell phone 
most of the time -- he actually wanted to short the Tibetan market, because he thought the monk was so 
stupid. He is amazing. Like a honeybee -- he talks to all these different people and cross-pollinates. Just 
two months ago, I was talking to him about a new alternative to evolutionary psychology. He got excited 
and sent me a check." 
Epstein has a particularly close relationship with Martin Nowak, an Austrian biology and mathematics 
professor who heads the theoretical-biology program at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. 
Nowak is examining how game theory can be used to answer some of the basic evolutionary questions —
e.g., why, in our Darwinian society, does altruistic behavior exist? Epstein talks to Nowak about once a 
week and flies him around the country to his various homes to deliver impromptu lectures. Over the past 
three years, he has written $500,000 worth of checks to fund Nowak's research. This past February, 
Epstein had Nowak over for dinner at the 71st Street townhouse. It was just the two of them (not 
including the wait staff), and Nowak, making use of a blackboard in the formal dining room, delivered a 
two-hour highly mathematical description of how language works. 
After dinner, Epstein asked if Nowak wanted to meet up with his new friend President Clinton, and off 
they went to a nearby deli, where Clinton regaled the starstruck former Oxford professor with tales from 
his own Oxford days. "Jeffrey has the mind of a physicist. Ifs like talking to a colleague in your field," 
says Nowak. "Sometimes he applies what we talk about to his investments. Sometimes it's for his own 
curiosity. He has changed my life. Because of his support, I feel I can do anything I want." 
Danny Hillis, an MIT-educated computer scientist whose company, Thinking Machines, was at the 
forefront of the supercomputing world in the eighties, and who used to run R&D at Walt Disney 
Imagineering, thinks Epstein is actually using scientific knowledge to beat the markets. "We talk about 
currency trading — the euro, the real, the yen," he says. "He has something a physicist would call 
physical intuition. He knows when to use the math and when to throw it away. If I had acted upon all the 
investment advice he has been giving me over the years, I'd be calling you from my Gulfstream right 
now." 
On the 727 these days, he has been reading a book by E. O. Wilson, the eminent scientist and originator 
of the field of sociobiology, called Consilience, which makes the case that the boundaries between 
scientific disciplines are in the process of breaking down. It's a view Epstein himself holds. He wrote 
recently to a scientist friend of his: "The behavior of termites, together with ants and bees, is a precursor 
to trust because they have an extraordinary ability to form relationships and sophisticated social 
structures based on mutual altruism even though individually they are fundamentally dumb. Money 
itself is a derivative of trust. If we can figure out how termites come together, then we may be able to 
better understand the underlying principles of market behavior 
and make big money." 
So how do termite grouping patterns fare as an investment strategy? Again, facts are hard to come by. A 
working day for Epstein starts at 5 a.m., when he gets up and scours the world markets on his 
Bloomberg screen — each of his houses, in New York, St. Thomas, Palm Beach, and New Mexico, as 
well as the 727, is equipped with the necessary hardware for him to wake up, roll out of bed, and start 
trading. He will put some calls in to his private banker at JPMorgan to get a reading as to how wealthy
