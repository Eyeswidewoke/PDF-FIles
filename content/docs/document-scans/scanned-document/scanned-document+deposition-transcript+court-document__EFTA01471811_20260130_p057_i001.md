payment; 
provided that, unless otherwise agreed between the parties, if Buyer or, as 
the case may be, the transferee has failed to make reasonable efforts to 
transfer the relevant Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities 
prior to such Income Payment Date in circumstances where the proviso to 
subparagraph (b)(i) above or, as the case may be, subparagraph (b)(ii) has 
been satisfied, then, instead of transferring or crediting the amount 
referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph (c), Buyer 
or, as the case may be, the transferee shall indemnify Seller or, as the 
case may be, the transferor in respect of any cost, loss (including for the 
avoidance of doubt the amount of Income that would have been paid to Seller 
or, as the case may be, the transferor if it had been the holder of such 
Securities on such Income Payment Date) or damage (excluding, for the 
avoidance of doubt, any consequential loss or damage) suffered by such 
person which it would not have suffered had the relevant Equivalent 
Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities been transferred prior to such 
Income Payment Date. 
(d) 
Where Buyer or, as the case may be, the transferee is required by 
law to make any transfer or credit pursuant to subparagraph (c)(i) or (ii) 
above subject to withholding or deduction of taxes or duties, and as a 
result would, but for this subparagraph, be required to pay additional 
amounts under paragraph 6(b) of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed 
between the parties, it shall only be obliged to pay such additional amounts 
to the extent that it could, in the relevant circumstances, have avoided, 
satisfied or off-set the relevant obligation to withhold or deduct (or to 
account for the tax withheld or deducted) by utilising any available tax 
credit in respect of the relevant Securities (or transactions relating to 
them).".

be, Equivalent Margin Securities have not been transferred) Buyer, in the

Securities, shall notify the other party within a reasonable time after the

received such notice from the issuer of any notice issued by the issuer of 
such Securities to the holders of such Securities relating to any proposed 
conversion, subdivision, consolidation, takeover, pre-emption, option or 
other similar right or event affecting such Securities or of any Income

of the Agreement as if the Transaction were an on demand Transaction or, 
where the relevant Securities are Margin Securities, request that Equivalent 
Margin Securities be transferred in respect of such Securities to paragraph 
8(d) of the Agreement; and/or (as appropriate); 
(ii)
