Section 8.12 
Waiver of Jury Trial. SECURED PARTY AND GRANTOR HEREBY EACH WAIVE THEIR 
RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT 
OF OR RELATED TO THE AIRCRAFT OR THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. THIS 
WAIVER IS MADE KNOWINGLY, WILLINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY SECURED PARTY AND GRANTOR, WHO 
EACH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO REPRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY ANY INDIVIDUAL TO INDUCE THIS 
WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY OR IN ANY WAY TO MODIFY OR NULLIFY ITS EFFECT. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO 
ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS. RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS HERETO. GRANTOR 
AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT ANY CLAIM AGAINST THE SECURED PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON 
INDEMNIFIED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT. 
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. 
Section 8.13 
Counterpart Execution; Joint and Several Liability. This Agreement and any amendments to this 
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of 
which, when so executed and delivered, will be an original, but all such counterparts will together constitute but one and 
the same instrument. Such counterparts may be exchanged via facsimile, dow-sign, pdf or similar form of electronic 
transmission. Fully executed sets of counterparts will be delivered to, and retained by, the Grantor and the Secured Party. 
If this Agreement is executed by more than one Person as Grantor, the obligations of all such signers hereunder will be 
joint and several and all references to "Grantor" will apply both jointly and severally. 
Section 8.14 
Substitution. Subject to the following conditions and Secured Party's consent, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld, Grantor shall have the option to sell the Aircraft to an unrelated third party and to replace it with an 
aircraft of a comparable (or better) make and model as the Aircraft which shall be free and clear of all Liens and shall 
have at least the Fair Market Value, utility and remaining useful life and be in as good an operating condition as the 
Aircraft and be reasonably satisfactory to Secured Party (the 'Replacement Aircraft"), on the date specified by Grantor in 
its notice to Secured Party ("Substitution Date"). Such Replacement Aircraft shall be in as good condition as the Aircraft, 
assuming the Aircraft was in the condition and repair required by the terms of this Agreement on the Substitution 
Date. This option (a "Substitution Option') may be exercised by Grantor provided that: (i) Grantor shall have entered into a 
contract (a copy of which shall be provided to Secured Party) for the sale of the Aircraft to an independent third party; (ii) 
unless waived in writing by Secured Party, Grantor shall have given Secured Party at least sixty (60) days' prior written 
notice of its intention to exercise the Substitution Option; (iii) no Default or Event of Default hereunder shall then have 
occurred and be continuing. At Grantor's expense, Secured Party shall cooperate with Grantor with respect to the sale 
and substitution contemplated herein. On the Substitution Date: (A) Grantor shall pay to Secured Party any applicable 
Taxes, if any, becoming due in connection with such substitution; (B) Grantor shall execute any further amendment of this 
Agreement and any other Loan Documents as reasonably requested by Secured Party to give effect to such substitution, 
which shall be filed for recording with the FAA. International Registry, relevant state UCC registries, and any other place 
reasonably requested by Secured Party, at Grantor's expense; and (C) Secured Party's security interest in the Aircraft 
shall terminate. Secured Party shall, at Grantor's expense. provide such other documents as may be required to release 
the Aircraft from the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to transfer to the purchaser its interest therein, and in any 
assignable manufacturer's or servicer's maintenance service contracts and/or extended warranties having been previously 
assigned by Grantor to Secured Party, in such form as may reasonably be requested by Grantor. For the avoidance of 
doubt, Secured Party and Grantor agree that there shall be no Prepayment Premium (as set forth in the Note) associated 
with any substitution pursuant to this Section 8.14. If Secured Party and Grantor fail to agree upon the Fair Market Value 
of the Replacement Aircraft before the Substitution Date, Secured Party will appoint an independent appraiser 
(reasonably acceptable to Grantor) to determine the fair market value of the Replacement Aircraft, and that determination 
will be final, binding and conclusive. Grantor agrees to pay the costs and expenses of any such appraisal. For the 
purposes of this Section 8.14, 'Fair Market Value' will be determined on the basis of, and will equal in value, the amount 
that would be obtained in an arm's length transaction between an informed and willing buyer (who is neither a lessee 
and/or debtor in possession nor a used equipment dealer) and an informed and willing seller, under no compulsion to sell, 
and in such determination costs of removal of the Replacement Aircraft from its then location will not be a deduction from 
such Fair Market Value.
