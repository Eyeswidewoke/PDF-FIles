Revision (DSM-IV-TR)(Arrterican Psychiatric Association, 2000). They are defined 
there as recurrent, intense, and sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviors 
that generally involve nonhuman objects, the suffering or humiliation of oneself 
or one's partner, or children or other nonconsenting persons and that occur over 
a period of at least six months. Better known and more common paraphilias 
include exhibitionism (exposure), fetishism (objects), frotteurism (rubbing), 
pedophilia (child), sexual masochism (self pain), sexual sadism (partner pain), 
and voyeurism (looking). Less known and less common paraphilias include 
scatologia (talk), necrophilia (corpses), partialism (body parts), zoophilia (animals), 
coprophilia (feces), klismaphilia (enemas), urophilia (urine), infantilism (baby), 
hebephilia (female youth), ephebophilia (male youth), and theoretically many 
others. 
In the real world each of the paraphilias typically has slang names (e.g., "big 
baby" "golden showers," "S&M"); an industry that sells related paraphernalia 
and props (e.g., restraining devices, dolls, adult-sized baby clothing); a support 
network (e.g., North American Man/Boy Love Association or NAMBLA, Diaper 
Pail Fraternity Internet newsgroups and that rooms); and a body of literature 
(e.g., pornography, newsletters). In fact the paraphilias are the organizational 
framework or the "Dewey Decimal System" of pornography, obscenity, adult 
bookstores, and Internet sex chat rooms. 
Individuals can and frequently do have more than one of these paraphilias. 
Paraphilias are psychosexual disorders and not types of sex crimes. They may or 
may not involve criminal activity. Individuals suffering from one or more of these 
paraphilias can just engage in fantasy and masturbate, or they can act out their 
fantasies legally (e.g., with consenting adult partners or objects), or they can act 
out their fantasies illegally (e.g., with nonconsenting partners or underage part-
ners). It is their choice. In addition not everyone committing a sex offense has a 
paraphilia. Their behavior patterns may be criminal, but not fit the specific diag-
nostic criteria of a paraphilia. 
MO and Ritual 
On an investigative level the presence of paraphilias often means highly repetitive 
and predictable behavior patterns focused on specific sexual interests that go well 
beyond a "method of operation" (MO). The concept of an MO—something done 
by an offender because it works and will help hint get away with the crime—is 
well known to most investigators. MO usually involves patterns of behavior 
intended to ensure success, protect identity, and facilitate escape. An MO is 
fueled by thought and deliberation. Most offenders change and improve their 
MO over time and with experience. 
The repetitive behavior patterns of some sex offenders can and do involve 
some MO, but are more likely to also involve the less-known concept of sexual 
ritual. Sexual ritual is the repeated engaging in an act or series of acts in a certain 
manner because of a sexual need; that is, in order to become fully aroused and/or 
gratified, a person must engage in the act in a certain way. If repeated often enough 
during sexual activity, some aspects of the MO of sex offenders can; through . 
behavioral conditioning, become part of the sexual ritual. Other types of ritual 
behavior can be motivated by psychological, cultural, or spiritual needs or some 
combination. Unlike an MO, ritual is necessary to the offender but not to the 
successful commission of the crime. In fad, instead of facilitating the crime, ritual
