consistent with the Code of Ethics: and 
Employees should not take inappropriate advantage of their position. 
Employees (and any accounts in which an employee has beneficial ownership) must obtain 
written authorization from the CCO prior to making a personal investment in other private 
investment vehicles. The Code of Ethics also provides that the CCO (or his designee) will

Sub-Advisers of the Direct Investment Funds maintain investment and trading authority on 
behalf of the Direct Investment Funds which should minimize any conflicts of interest that may 
arise out of the employees' personal trading activities. Furthermore, iCapital generally provides 
to each Sub-Adviser a list of companies at which any of iCapital's related persons has a 
material financial interest (e.g., board membership) so that such Sub-Adviser may include such 
company on its own restricted list. The spirit of the Code of Ethics is to discourage frequent 
trading in personal employee accounts. Employees also may not participate in any initial public 
offerings or engage in any outside business activities or private placements without obtaining 
prior written authorization from the CCO. iCapital's Code of Ethics is available upon request
