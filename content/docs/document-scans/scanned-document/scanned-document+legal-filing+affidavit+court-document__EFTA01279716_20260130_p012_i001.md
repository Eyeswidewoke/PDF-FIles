(h) 
Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any 
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability 
without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability shall not 
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Captions are intended for 
convenience or reference only, and shall not be construed to define, limit or describe the scope or intent 
of any provisions hereof. 
19. 
Definitions. 
"Commodity Exchange Act" means the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), as 
amended from time to time, and any successor statute. 
"Excluded Swa. °bile ation" means, with respect to any guarantor of a Swap Obligation, including 
the grant of a security interest to secure the guaranty of such Swap Obligation, any Swap Obligation if, 
and to the extent that, such Swap Obligation is or becomes illegal under the Commodity Exchange Act or 
any rule, regulation or order of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or the application or official 
interpretation of any thereof) by virtue of such guarantor's failure for any reason to constitute an "eligible 
contract participant" as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder at the 
time the guaranty or grant of such security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap 
Obligation. If a Swap Obligation arises under a master agreement governing more than one swap, such 
exclusion shall apply only to the portion of such Swap Obligation that is attributable to swaps for which 
such Swap Obligation or security interest is or becomes illegal.

derivative transactions (e.g., equity or equity index swaps, options, caps, floors, collars and forwards), 
including without limitation any ISDA Master Agreement between Borrower and Lender or any affiliate of 
Fifth Third Bancorp, and any schedules, confirmations and documents and other confirming evidence
