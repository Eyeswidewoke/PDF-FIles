Impact of Uninvested Cash Balances; Unpaid Accrued Interest on Collateral. To the extent the Investment 
Manager (on behalf of the Issuer) maintains cash balances invested in short-term investments instead of higher 
>ielding obligations, portfolio income will be reduced which will result in reduced amounts available for 
distributions on the Securities, in particular the Subordinated Securities. On the Closing Date, the Issuer is expected 
to have significant uninvested proceeds. This will likely reduce the amount of Interest Proceeds that would 
otherwise be available to distribute to the holders of the Subordinated Securities, particularly on the first Distribution 
Date. If the Issuer issues additional securities after the Closing Date, the Issuer would likely have significant 
uninvested proceeds of the offering, pending investment in Collateral Obligations. The extent to which cash 
balances remain uninvested will be subject to a variety of factors, including future market conditions and is difficult 
to predict. 
In addition, there will be a mismatch between the payment dates of the Collateral Obligations and the Distribution 
Dates with respect to the Securities. Accordingly. interest that has accrued on Collateral Obligations during a Due 
Period may not be received by the Issuer during such Due Period, which may adversely affect the Issuer's ability to 
make payments and distributions on the Securities, particularly the Subordinated Securities, on any particular 
Distribution Date. 
Calculation of Overcollateralization Tests If any Coverage Test is not satisfied as of any Determination Date, cash 
flows otherwise payable to Lower Ranking Classes of Securities will be diverted to the payment of principal of 
Higher Ranking Classes of Rated Notes as set forth in the Priority of Payments. Calculation of the Principal 
Balance of Collateral Obligations for purposes of the Overeollateralization Tests applies certain reductions to the par 
amount of Collateral Obligations as set forth in the definition of Principal Balance. For example, for purposes of 
this calculation, a Defaulted Obligation will have a Principal Balance that is the lesser of its Market Value or 
Recovery Rate and the excess of Collateral Obligations with an S&P Rating of "CCC+" or lower or a Moody's 
Obligation Rating of "Caul" or lower exceed certain levels will have a Principal Balance equal to their Market 
Value. See clause (d) of the definition of Principal Balance. Such reductions may increase the likelihood that one 
or more Overcollateralization Tests is not satisfied and cash flows otherwise payable to Lower Ranking Classes of 
Securities will be diverted to the payment of principal of Higher Ranking Classes of Rated Notes. 
Valuation Information; Limited Information. Neither the Issuer nor any other party will be required to provide 
periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. Investors will receive limited information with regard to the 
Collateral Obligations and nonc of the Co-Issuers. Trustee, or Investment Manager will be required to provide any 
information other than what is required in the Indenture. Furthermore. if any information is provided to the holders 
(including required reports under the Indenture), such information may not be audited. Finally. the Investment 
Manager may be in possession of material, non-public information with regard to the Collateral Obligations and will 
not be required to disclose such information to the holders. 
Control of Remedies. The Controlling Party will have the right to direct certain actions and control certain 
decisions, including if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to remedies and acceleration of 
maturity on the Notes. providing consent to certain amendments of the Indenture. and directing or consenting to 
certain actions under the Investment Management Agreement with respect to removal for cause of the Investment 
Manager and appointment of a successor manager. The remedies and other actions pursued by the Controlling Patty 
could be adverse to the interests of holders of other Classes of Securities. For example, the Controlling Party could 
vote to direct the Trustee to liquidate the Collateral to facilitate payment of amounts due in respect of the Notes of 
the Controlling Class even if a delay in the exercise of such remedy might permit the value of the Collateral to 
increase to the benefit of the holders of other Classes of Notes. 
Amendments to the Indenture. The Indenture may be amended, and in many cases may be amended without the 
consent of holders of Notes. Such amendments could be adverse to certain owners of Notes. See "The Indenture 
and the Fiscal Agency Agreement—Amendments of the Indenture." 
Average Life and Prepayment Considerations. The average life of the Rated Notes is expected to be shorter than 
the number of years remaining to the Stated Maturity. The avenge life of the Rated Notes will be affected by a 
number of factors, including any Optional Redemption. any Special Redemption or acceleration described herein, 
the amount and frequency of principal payments as a result of the failure of Coverage Tests or a Continuing 
Effective Date Ratings Confirmation Failure, the financial condition of the obligors of the underlying Collateral 
Obligations and the characteristics of such obligations, including the stated maturity, existence and frequency of
