whose identity they could not be allowed to 
know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the mon-
ey came from him, and Towers's financial 
statements for that year show a loan to Ep-
stein of 5400.000. (Epstein has said he 
can't remember the details and has dis-
puted the accuracy of the Towers financial 
reports.) 
Around the same time. Nederlander and 
Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a 
scheme to make money out of Pennwalt, a 
Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan 
was to group together with two other panics 
to take a substantial declared position in the 
stock. According to a source, Epstein was 
supposed tb help Nededander and Toboroff 
raise $1S million. He seemed to fad to find 
other investors. say those familiar with the 
deal. (Epstein has said be was merely an in-
vestor.) He invested SI million. which he 
told his co-investors was his own money. 
But in his 1989 deposi-
(ion he said that he put 
in only $300.000 of his 
own money, Where did 
the rest come from? Hof-
fenberg has said it came 
from him. in a loan that 
Nededander and Toboroff 
didn't knot. about. 
Two things happened 
that alarmed Nederlander 
and Toborotf. After the 
group signaled a possible 
takeover. the Pennwalt 
management threatened to 
sue the would-be nutters. 
Epstein was reluctant ini-
tially to give a deposition 
about his share of the 
money. telling Toboroff 
there were "reasons- he 
didn't want to. Then. after the opportunity 
for new investors was closed, co-investors 
recall Epstein announcing that he'd found 
one at last: Dick Any'der then C.E.O. of 
the publisher Simon .S: Scanner. who want-
ed to put up approximately $500,000. (Nei-
ther Epstein nor Snyder can now recall 
the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition 
Epstein said that he had recruited Sny-
der. whom he had met socially. into the 
deal.) 
According to a source. Toboroff and Ne-
derlander told Epstein (hat Snyder was too 
late. but. without their realizing it. Hoffen-
!.eig has claimed. Snyder wrote a check to 
Hotrenberg and bought out some of his in-
vestment. But then Snyder wanted out. 
"Nederlander started to get these irate 
calls from (Snyder.] who wasn't pan of the 
deal. saying he was owed all this money.-
says someone dose to the deal. Toboroff 
ar.t *derlander were baffled.

Ma 
. )ni 
rust as Nederlander and Toboroff were 
growing wary of Epstein. he became in-
creasingly invoked with Leslie Wexner. whom 
he had met through insurance executive 
Robert Meister and his late wife. Epstein has 
told people that he met Vibmer in 1986 in 
Palm Beach. and that he won his confidence 
by persuading him not to invest in the stock 
market, just as the 1987 crash was approach-
ing. His story has subsequently changed. 
When asked if Wexner knew about his con-
nection to Hoffenberg. Epstein said that he 
began working for Wexner in 1989. and that 
'it was certainly not the same time.-
Wherever and whenever it was that Ep-
stein and Wexner actually met, there was 
an immediate and strong personal chem-
istry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is -very 
smart with a combination of excellent judg-
ment and unusually high standards. Also. 
he is always a most loyal friend:' 
OFFICE SPACE 
The -office" in Epucin's house. It has no 
computers. but it does have a desk that 
Epstein tells people once belonged to hanker 
J. P. Morgan. and "the largest Persian rug 
you'll ever see in a private home." 
Sources say Epstein proved that Ise could 
be useful to Wexner as well with "fresh" 
ideas about investments. "Abner had a cou-
ple of bad investments. and Jeffrey cleaned 
those up right away." says a former associ-
ate of Epstein's. 
Before be signed on with Wexner. Epstein 
had several meetings vv,th Harold Levin. then 
head of Wexner Investments, in which he 
enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin 
found incomprehensibk. "In Eta:. says some-
one who used to work very closely with Wes-
ner. -almost everyone at the Limited won-
dered who Epstein was: he literally came 
out of nowhere," 
-Everyone was mystified as to what his 
appeal was." says Robert Moreisky. .1 timmer 
vice-clmirman of the Limited. 
M
uch of Epstein's work is related to clean-
ing up, tightening budgets. and efficien-
cies. One person who worked for 9tx.ner and 
who saw a contract drawn up between the 
two men says Epstein is involved in "every-
thing, not just a little here. a little there. 
Everything!" In addition, he says. "Ykxner 
likes having a hatchet man. . 
Whenever 
there is dirty work to be done he'd stick Jet
frey on it. . . . He has a reputation for being 
ruthless but he gets the job done." 
Epstein has evidently been asked to fire 
personal-staff members when needed. "He 
was that mystenctis person that everyone was 
scared to death of." says a former employee. 
Meanwhile. he is also less than popular 
with souse people onside Wemer's company 
with whom he now deals. "He 'inserted' 
himself into the construction process of Les-
lie Wexner's yacht. . . . That resulted in liti-
gation down the road between Mr. Wexner 
and the shipyard that 
eventually built the sts-

the end the matter was settled. but Ep-
stein claims he now has no recollection 
of it. 
The incident bort of a number of disputes 
Epstein has become embroiled in. Sonic arc 
few sums so tiny as to he baling: for instance. 
Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert 
Glass, who sold him the Palm Beach house in 
1990, for SB,444- Epstein claimed this was 
owed him for furnishings removed by Glass. 
In 1998 the U.S. Attorneys Office sued 
Epstein for illegally subletting the (triter

to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Epaein
