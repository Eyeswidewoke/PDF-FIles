address staleness, the only trait that matters is the tendency to add to and the 
unlikeliness to discard collected pornography and erotica. The expert's opinion 
concerning other behavioral traits could be used to justify searching a storage 
locker or computer at work. It could also be used to justify searching for related 
paraphernalia or videotapes. 
Not all offenders who might traffic in child pornography have these traits; 
therefore, the affidavit must set forth the reasons for the expert's conclusion that 
the subject of the search is among the particular groui, of offenders with the 
stated characteristics. The informational basis for the expert's opinion must be 
reliable, sufficient, and documented. The information must be from reliable sources 
and in sufficient quantity and quality to support the belief. Details concerning the 
information must be meticulously recorded and retrievable especially if it is the 
basis for a warrant sought by another agency or department. 
At this point it is useful to have a name for "these guys" with these distinctive 
characteristics. Although investigators have frequently called them "pedophiles" 
or "child-pornography collectors," the term preferential sex offender is recom-
mended for the reasons previously stated. Expert search warrants describing highly 
predictable offender characteristics should be used only for subjects exhibiting 
preferential sexual-behavior patterns. The characteristics, dynamics, and 
techniques (i.e., expert search warrant) discussed concerning preferential sex 
offenders should be considered with any of the preferential-type offenders. It is 
usually unnecessary to distinguish which type of preferential offender is involved. 
If the available facts do not support the belief that the subject is a preferential 
sex offender and deficiencies in the warrant cannot be addressed in other ways, 
investigators can always attempt to get a consent to search. Believe it or not, many 
sex offenders, especially preferential offenders, will give such consent. This is 
often true even if they have child pornography and other incriminating evidence 
in their home or computer. Their need to explain and validate their behavior 
overcomes their fear of discovery. 
Whenever possible affidavits for search warrants should. 
be based on reliable, case-specific facts. Because of legal 
uncertainties, expert search warrants should be used only 
when absolutely necessary. They should not be a replace-
ment for reasonable investigation. When such warrants are 
used, the affidavit must reflect the specific facts and details 
of the case in question. Boilerplate warrants, "ponies," or 
"go-bys" should be avoided. It is also best if the expert used 
is part of the investigation or from the local area. Regional 
or national experts should be used only when a local expert 
is unavailable. 
An offender's pornography 
and erotica collection is 
the single best indicator 
of what he wants to do. 
It is not necessarily the 
best indicator of what 
he did or will do. 
An o -4 • er s pomograp y and erotica co lection is the single best indicator of 
what he wants to do. It is not necessarily the best indicator of what he did or will 
do. Not all collectors of child pornography physically molest children, and not all 
molesters of children collect child pornography. Not all children depicted in child 
pornography have been sexually abused. For example some have been surrepti-
tiously photographed while undressing or bathing, and others have been
