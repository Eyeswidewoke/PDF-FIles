Woyciechowski and Lomnicki (1987) perform a calculation 
based on population genetics and conclude that workers should 
raise their nephews (sons of other workers) if the queen mates 
once, but should only raise their brothers (sons of the queen) if the 
queen mates more than twice—the case of double mating is neu-
tral with respect to preference. From this result, they claim that, 
under multiple mating of the queen, natural selection should favor 
non-reproductive workers. Woyciechowski and Lomnicki (1987) 
consider both dominant and recessive alleles affecting worker 
behavior, but they do not consider colony efficiency effects. 
Ratnieks (1988, considers the invasion of a dominant allele for 
policing. Using population genetics, he arrives at essentially the 
same conclusion as Woyciechowski and Lomnicki (1987): In the 
absence of efficiency effects, policing evolves with triple mating 
but not with single mating. But Ramieks also considers colony 
efficiency effects, focusing mainly on the case where policing 
improves colony efficiency. Since policing occurs alongside other 
maintenance tasks (such as cleaning of cells. removal of patho-
gens, incubation of brood), and since eating worker-laid eggs 
might allow workers to recycle some of the energy lost from laying 
eggs. Ramieks supposes that policing improves colony efficiency. 
He finds that worker policing with singly mated queens may 
evolve if policing improves colony reproductive efficiency. He also 
finds that worker policing with triply mated queens may not 
evolve if policing reduces colony reproductive efficiency, but he 
considered this case to be unlikely on empirical grounds. Ratnieks 
does not study recessive policing alleles. He also does not calculate 
evolutionary stability conditions. 
Both papers (Woyciechowski and Lomnicki. 1987; Ratnieks, 
1988) offer calculations based on population genetics without 
mentioning or calculating inclusive fitness. These early studies 
(Starr. 1984; Seeley, 1985; Woyciechowski and Lomnicki. 1987; 
Ratnieks. 1988) were instrumental in establishing the field of 
worker policing. 
Testing theoretical predictions on the evolution of worker 
policing in the field or in the lab is difficult Due to the complex-
ities inherent in insect sociality, published empirical results are not 
always easy to interpret. While, so far, winter policing has been 
found in all species with multiple mating that have been studied, it 
has also been found in about 20% of species with singly mated 
queens (I lammond 
and 
Keller. 
2004; 
Wenseleers 
and 
Ratnieks. 2006b; Bonckaert et al.. 2008). Herein lies the difficulty: 
When worker policing is found in multiply mated species and 
found to be absent in singly mated species, this is taken as evi-
dence supporting the relatedness argument, and when worker 
policing is found in singly mated species, it is explained away as 
not being evidence against the theory, but as having evolved for 
other reasons (such as colony efficiency). See, for example, the 
following quotation by Bonckaert et al. (2008): 'Nevertheless. our 
results are important in that they show that V. germanica forms no 
exception to the rule that worker reproduction should be effec-
tively policed in a species where queens mate multiple times 
(Ratnieks, 1988). Indeed, any exception to this pattern would be a 
much bigger challenge to the theory than the occurrence of 
worker policing in species with single mating, which can be 
readily explained (Ratnieks, 1988; Foster and Ratnieks. 2001b)." 
This is precisely why a careful simultaneous consideration of 
relatedness, male parentage, and colony efficiency is important for 
understanding worker policing. 
We do not aim to provide an exhaustive catalog of all species in 
which worker policing has been studied. We merely cite some 
specific examples to add context Policing is rampant in colonies of 
the honeybee (Ratnieks and Visscher. 1989), the wasp Vesputa 
vutgaris (Foster and Ratnieks, 2001c), and the wasp Vespula ger-
manica (Bonckaert et al., 2008), which are all multiply mated. (As 
mentioned above, worker policing has been found in all of the 
studied species to date that are multiply mated.) Worker removal 
of worker-laid eggs is much less prevalent in colonies of the 
bumblebee (Velthuis et al., 2002), the stingless bee, (Peters et al.. 
1999), and the wasp, Vespula rata (Wenseleers et al.. 2005), which 
are predominantly singly mated. (As mentioned above, worker 
policing has been found only in about 20% of the studied species to 
date that are singly mated.) There are some studies based on 
observational evidence that find policing in singly mated species; 
examples of species with single mating and worker policing are 
Vespa crobro (Foster et al.. 2002), Camponotusjlortdanus (Endler et 
al., 2004), Aphaenogaster smythiesi (Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 
200bh). and DitIC0MM0 (Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 20061), 
Interspecies comparisons are somewhat problematic, because 
even though phylogeny can be controlled for, there are many 
(known and unknown) ways in which species differ in addition to 
mating frequency that may also affect the absence or presence of 
worker policing. Furthermore. many empirical studies are based 
on genetic analyses of male parentage. (Though studies of some 
species are based on actual observational evidence: see. e.g., 
Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 2006b.) Regarding species for which the 
study of policing is based on genetic analyses, policing is often 
inferred if males are found to originate predominantly from the 
queen. But such an inference, in cases where it is made, pre-
supposes that workers actively try to lay male eggs in the first 
place. It is therefore not clear how reliably genetic investigations 
can measure policing. 
The small number of attempts at measuring the prevalence of 
worker policing in intraspecific experiments have also returned 
conflicting results. Foster and Ratnieks (2000) report that facul-
tative worker policing in the saxon wasp. Dolichovespula saxonica. 
is more common in colonies headed by multiply mated queens. 
But their sample size is only nine colonies. The phenomenon was 
reinvestigated by Ronckaert et al. (2011) who report no evidence 
of facultative worker policing depending on queen mating fre-
quencies, and argue that the previous result may have been flawed 
or that there were interpopulational variations. 
Many empirical studies have emphasized that factors besides 
intracolony relatedness—including the effects of policing on a 
colony's rate of production of offspring—may play a role in 
explaining evolution of worker policing (Foster and Ratnieks 
2001a,c: Hartmann et al_ 2003; Hammond and Keller. 2004; 
Wenseleers and Ratnieks. 2006b; Helantera and Sundstrom. 2007; 
Khila and Abouheif. 2008; Zanette et al. 2012). Yet reliable pub-
lished data on the effect that policing has on colony reproductive 
efficiency are often hard to find. (For some exceptions, see 
Wenseleers et al.. 2013 and references therein.) 
In this paper, we derive precise conditions for the evolutionary 
invasion and evolutionary stability of police alleles. We consider 
any number of matings, changes in the proportion of queen-
derived males, changes in colony efficiency, and both dominant 
and recessive mutations that affect the intensity of policing, 
Our paper is based on an analysis of evolutionary dynamics and 
population genetics of haplodiploid species (Nowak et al., 2010; 
Olejarz et al., 2015). It does not use inclusive fitness theory. Spe-
cifically, we adapt the mathematical approach that was developed 
by Olejarz in al. (2015) for the evolution of non-reproductive 
workers. We derive evolutionary invasion and stability conditions 
for police alleles. Mathematical details are given in Appendix A. 
In Section 2, we present the basic model and state the general 
result for any number of matings for dominant policing alleles. In 
Sections 3-5, we specifically discuss single, double. and triple 
mating for dominant policing alleles. We take dominance of the 
policing allele to be the more realistic possibility because the 
policing phenotype is a gained function. Nonetheless. for com-
pleteness, we give the general result for recessive policing alleles 
in Section 6. In Section 7, we discuss how the shape of the
