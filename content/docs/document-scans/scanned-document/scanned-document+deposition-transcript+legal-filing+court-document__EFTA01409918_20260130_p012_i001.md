Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA 
This prospectus includes industry and market data that we obtained from 
periodic industry publications such as those by the National 
Restaurant Association, third-party studies and surveys and internal company 
surveys. These sources include government and industry sources. 
Industry publications and surveys generally state that the information 
contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable. 
Although we believe the industry and market data to be reliable as of the 
date of this prospectus, this information could prove to be inaccurate. 
Industry and market data could be wrong because of the method by which 
sources obtained their data and because information cannot always be 
verified with complete certainty due to the limits on the availability and 
reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process 
and other limitations and uncertainties. In addition, we do not know all of 
the assumptions regarding general economic conditions or growth that 
were used in preparing the forecasts from the sources relied upon or cited 
herein. 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this prospectus to 
"Fogo de Chao, Inc.," "we," "us," "our," and "our company" are, 
collectively, to Fogo de Chao, Inc., a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 
2012, the issuer of the common stock offered hereby, and its 
consolidated subsidiaries. 
Fogo de Chao, Inc. (the "Successor") was incorporated under the name Brasa 
(Parent) Inc. on May 24, 2012 in connection with the acquisition 
(the "Acquisition") on July 21, 2012 of Fogo de Chao Churrascaria (Holdings) 
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and its parent company, 
FC Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands exempt company, by a collaborative group 
consisting of funds affiliated with Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. 
("THL" and along with such funds and their affiliates, the "THL Funds") and 
other minority investors. The Successor owns 100% of Brasa 
(Purchaser) Inc. ("Brasa Purchaser"), which owns 100% of Brasa (Holdings) 
Inc. ("Brasa Holdings"). Brasa Holdings owns 100% of Fogo de Ch8o 
(Holdings) Inc. ("Fogo Holdings"), which owns the Successor's domestic and 
foreign operating subsidiaries. Immediately prior to the Acquisition, 
(i) FC Holdings Inc. contributed all of its ownership interests in Fogo de 
Chao Churrascaria (Holdings) LLC to Fogo Holdings, (ii) Fogo de Chao 
Churrascaria (Holdings) LLC was merged with Fogo Holdings, which was the 
surviving corporation, and (iii) FC Holdings Inc. was domesticated 
into Brasa Holdings. Promptly thereafter, Brasa Parent acquired Brasa 
Holdings through a reverse subsidiary merger of its subsidiary, Brasa 
Merger Sub Inc., with Brasa Holdings, which was the surviving corporation. 
The Acquisition was financed by loans to Brasa Holdings and equity 
contributions by the THL Funds and certain members of management. 
As a result of the Acquisition, the financial information for all periods 
after May 24, 2012 represents the financial information of the 
Successor. Prior to, and including, July 20, 2012, the consolidated 
financial statements include the accounts of the "Predecessor" company. 
Financial information in the Predecessor period relates to Fogo de Chao
