PROVIDES VISUAL REFERENCE OF AIRCRAFT POSITION RELATIVE TO LANDING FACIL(TIES, NAVIGATIONAL AIDS AND 
SPECIAL USE AIRSPACE. THE ARGUS 5000/CE RECEIVES GEODETIC POSITION AND OTHER NAVIGATION INFORMATION 
FROM THE NO. 1 UNS- ID FMS THROUGH AN EVENTIDE AVIONICS ARINC 419/429 ADAPTER UNIT AND THE AIRCRAFT'S NO. 3 
HONEYWELL "LASERREF" INERTIAL REFERENCE SENSOR (IRS) DIRECTIONAL HEADING SYSTEM WHICH, PROVIDES MAP 
GRAPHICS AND BEARING ORIENTATION. 
THE FOLLOWING SWITCHES ARE LOCATED ON P16 FORWARD CONTROL STAND. BELOW THE ARGUS 5000 CE MOVING MAP
