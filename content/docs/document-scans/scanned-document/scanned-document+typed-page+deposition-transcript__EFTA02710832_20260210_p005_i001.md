is comparable to the dependence on other physical parameter 
uncertainties. which are themselves small. While this may be 
important for model building purposes, it does not affect the 
robustness of the fact that larger disfavors Higgs Inflation.

Appendix A: Standard Model Effective Potential 
The Standard Model effective potential is calculated (i) to 
the one-loop order. (ii) working in the MS renormalization 
scheme with renormalization scale p, and (iii) in the tenor-
malizable class of gauges (Re) as follows: 
Vergh ) = 0 °)(h) + 1,(1)(h) . 
(Al) 
The tree-level potential is 
V(o)(h) = 4 
—h4 , 
(A2) 
and we can neglect the O(h°) and O(h2) terms for the pur-
poses of studying HI where the field value is large. The one-
loop correction is [55] (sec also [34] for gauge dependent fac-
tors)

where we have neglected the light fermions. We also neglect 
the contribution from the Higgs mass term. During inflation, 
the potential is very flat and this contribution is subdominant. 
The remaining SM fields, the massless photon and gluons, do 
not enter the effective potential at the one-loop order. The

where 1/2 = 1 + Ch2/1111, was given by Eq. (2). We denote 
the gauge fixing parameter by Car to distinguish it from the 
non-minimal gravitational coupling parameter, 
We implement the RG improvement as per 152-511. (See 
also the reviews [55, 56]). This consists of (I) solving the 
RG equations (RGEs) to determine the running parameters as 
functions of the RG flow parameter 1, (2) replacing the vari-
ous coupling constants in Kg with the corresponding running 
parameter. and (3) evaluating the RG flow parameter at the 
appropriate value t = 1. so as to minimize the would-be large 
logarithms. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
discussion, 
let 
us 
denote 
the 
running 
parameters 
collectively 
as 4(t) 
{43(1), 42(t), oi(t), A(t), fh(t), (1)} where 92 = g and 
91 = 9'. Then the RGEs take the form fie, /(1 + -y) = do /dt 
with the boundary condition M' t = 0) = co. Here 7 is 
the anomalous dimension of the Higgs field. We neglect 
the running of the gauge-fixing parameter. 4r, since it is 
self-renormalized. This approximation is reasonable since 
we focus on 4-1- < 4r; for larger values of est-, perturba-
tivity becomes an issue. The Higgs field runs according to 
—7/1 = dh/dt where the anomalous dimension -y(t) is given 
as [571

This last equation may be solved immediately along with the 
boundary condition h(t = 0) = Ae to obtain 
h(t) = 
et(t) 
(A6) 
where 
= — f cf, 7(9)/(1 + 7(e)) de and we seek to cal-
culate the effective potential as a function of h,.. The beta 
functions are independent of 4f 
• but the anomalous dimen-
sion is gauge-variant since the Higgs field is a gauge-variant 
operator. Finally, the renormalization scale runs according to 
= dµ/dt, which may be solved along with 11(t = 0) = po 
to obtain Q(t) = poet. 
We solve the one-loop beta functions using the Mathe-
matica code made publicly available by Fedor Bezrukov at 
http: //www. lox .ac ru/ - fedor/SH/ . The code im-
plements the matching at the electroweak scale to determine 
the couplings, c,,o. at the wale po = Mt in terms of the phys-
ical masses and parameters. The code was extended (I) by 
generalizing the anomalous dimension to the RE gauge as in 
Eq. (A5). and (2) by including the field-dependent factors of 
1+ 4(0,4102
rp 
1 + (1 +64.(0)4(02422 
(A7) 
in the two-loop beta functions, as indicated by 1131. The factor 
of s arises because of the non-canonical Higgs kinetic term.
