S. 
Payment. Holder will be furnished at the address identified by Holder, 
a monthly statement for each account for each billing period at the end of which 
there is an undisputed debit or credit balance of $1.00 or more. The full amount 
billed ("Nov Balance") is due on demand. If Issuer does not demand payment of 
the New Balance on the monthly billing statement., either (a) the New Balance or, 
(b) a Minimum Payment of the greater of S20 or 5 % of the New Balance, 
shall be paid within 25 days after the Closing Date of that billing statement. 
Payments must be made at ElankCard Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53288-

account. Payments received after 2:00 P.M. on any Monday through Friday,

will be considered as payments made on the following banking day. Alt 
payments will be applied first to interest, second to additional fees, if any, in the 
order of their entry to the account, third to previously billed cash advances, 
purchases and other similar charges in the order of their entry.to the account, and 
then to current cash advances, purchases and other similar charges in the order of

Finance Charges. Interest shall accrue on each account as shown on 
the monthly statements, for each billing period in which there is a cash advance or 
the Previous Balance is not paid in full prior to the Closing Date of the billing 
statement. hneraat Is computed by applying the moodily periodic rate of 
1.208% (ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE OF 14.5%) to the average daily 
balance of the account. To get the average daily balance, we take die beginning 
balance of the account each day, add any new cash advances, credit purchases 
and other charges, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid late charges, 
unpaid membership fees and other unpaid fees. This gives us the daily balance.

Then, we add up all of the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total 
by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance. 
Interest accrues on credit purchases beginning on the date the purchase is posted 
to the account unless the Previous Balance shown on the statement is paid in full 
prior to the Closing Date of the statement. Credit purchases made during the 
statement period and the Previous Balance will be excluded from the calculation 
of average daily balance if the Previous Balance shown on the front of the 
statement is paid in full prior to the Closing Dale. Interest on cash advances 
begins to x..-ue on the date the advance is posted to the account. Additional 
interest on an account may be avoided by paying in full the New Balance shown 
on the account's monthly statement within 25 days after the Closing Date fur that 
statement.

the government mandated exchange rate or the wholesale exchange rate, in effect 
one day before the date of the conversion, as applicable. The exchange rate is 
increased by 1% if the conversions made in connection with a charge to an 
account and decreased by I% if the conversion is made in connection with a credit 
to an account. The date of conversion by VISA may differ from the purchase date 
and the posting date identified in the monthly statement for the account. Holder

accordance with the terms of this paragraph.
