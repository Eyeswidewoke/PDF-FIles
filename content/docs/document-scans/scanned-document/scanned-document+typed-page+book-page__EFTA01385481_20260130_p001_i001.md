In addition to building out existing licenses, mobile operators may also have 
the opportunity to scoop up more spectrum in the coming years, particularly in 
the mid-to-high band frequencies. The FCC has previously explored auctioning 
off 150 MHz of 3.5 GHz although the process hasn't progressed and timing is 
unclear. The FCC has agreed to auction off various mmWave bands (>28 GHZ 
and higher). Most recently, Intelsat and Intel jointly responded to an FCC N0l 
seeking to offer a commercial solution to freeing up some of its valuable C-
band spectrum 500 MHz of C-band (3.7-4.2 GHz), but FCC has yet to weigh in 
on the proposal or set out a path forward. As we can see, the focus on mid-to-
high-band fits nicely with the carriers eyes set on 56 so we expect 
conversations around freeing up more of those frequencies to heat up 
throughout the year. 
Competitive Landscape: Since the last round of major M&A in the wireless 
industry back in 2013, which established the current 4-player national 
landscape we know today, the market has not only seen stiff competition, but 
a material shift in the way management teams have done business. T-Mobile's 
Un-carrier initiatives created device financing plans, altered funding options, 
and unleashed a slew of plan offerings that has pressured ARPUs for years. 
Sprint and T-Mobile positioned themselves in the market as the mobile 
companies with the best value, which opened up more GBs I $, and eventually 
led the Big-2 to offer Unlimited plans at price points below existing plans while 
also eliminating overages, which had a large impact especially in 1H17. 
While it has been a difficult few years across the industry, lately we've seen 
more rational behavior with respect to pricing. Sprint, who considers itself the 
"price leader" in the industry, implemented a price increase in CY3Q17 with 
the intent of raising prices again in corning quarters. Management has spoken 
of service revenue inflection in the back-end of 2018 so we expect Sprint's 
pricing to continue to improve from here. T-Mobile's pricing has been generally 
stable all year and any future pressure in coming quarters will likely come from 
contra-revenue items such as the recent Netflix add-on. We expect T-Mobile to 
remain disciplined in pricing as it seeks to achieve its FCF CAGR guidance of 
45-48% over the next 3 years. After taking big hits early on in the Unlimted 
adoption and no overages phase, the Big-2 are moderating as well. Wireless 
CPI trends have been more of less stable since April 2017 so the carrier 
specific anecdotes and broader sentiments are being reflected in the macro 
data. 
The other sources of competition that are really coming into view now are the 
cable companies. Three of the four largest cable companies in the US now 
have some sort of agreements in place with a nationwide carrier to offer 
wireless services over their network. In our opinion, the most at risk are the 
Big-2 given their dominant market share in many geographies. The arrival of a 
competing service utilizing the same infrastructure could put new pressure on 
the likes of Verizon and AT&T, particularly since cable is primarily utilizing the 
quad-play bundle to extend the lifetime value of customers and reduce churn 
as opposed to chase profits. 
Still at the center of the discussion around the future of wireless is DISH 
Network. Another year goes by and DISH acquires more spectrum (low band 
auction in January 2017) but also still keeps its strategy around a 5G 
broadband network fairly mysterious. While we now know of their intention to 
build a narrowband loT network, even this is likely a temporary step along an 
evolutionary path to rolling out a true wireless 5G network of the future. 
Chatter from earlier in the year on potential partners for DISH are not worth 
repeating here. Our experience with the company over many years tells us 
that talk surrounding DISH is never spurred by the company itself as senior 
management is notoriously tight-lipped with everyone about anything strategic. 
When will we know more? Well, our best guess does lead us to the back half 
of 2018. With 5G standards progressing through 3GPP for both consumer as
