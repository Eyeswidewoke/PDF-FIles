How Papers Are Scored 
The student responses are scored by trained readers using the holistic method to evaluate 
a piece of writing for its overall quality. The readers consider four elements: focus, 
organization, support, and conventions. In this type of scoring, readers make a judgment 
about the entire response and do not focus on any one aspect of the writing. 
Focus refers to how clearly the paper presents and maintains a clear main idea, 
theme, or unifying point. Papers representing the higher end of the point scale 
demonstrate a consistent awareness of the topic and do not contain extraneous 
information. 
Organization refers to the structure or plan of development (beginning, middle, 
and end) and whether the points are logically related to one another. Organization 
also refers to (I) the use of transitional devices to relate the supporting ideas to the 
main idea, theme, or unifying point and (2) the evidence of a connection between 
sentences. Papers representing the higher end of the point scale use transitions to 
signal the plan or text structure and end with summary or concluding statements. 
Support refers to the quality of the details used to explain, clarify, or define. The 
quality of the support depends on word choice, specificity, depth, and 
thoroughness. Papers representing the higher end of the point scale provide 
examples and illustrations in which the relationship between the supporting ideas 
and the topic is clear. 
Conventions refers to punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and variation in 
sentence structure used in the paper. The conventions are basic writing skills 
included in Florida's Sunshine State Standards. Papers representing the higher end 
of the point scale follow, with few exceptions, the conventions of punctuation, 
capitalization, and spelling and use a variety of sentence structures to present 
ideas. 
Dear Student: 
The paper you wrote in February as part of the FCAT has been read 
independently by two people trained to score this test. Each reader 
judged the paper against standards set by Florida educators and gave it 
an overall score. Your score is the average of the two readers' scores. 
This writing score will help you, your parents or guardians, and your 
teachers understand how well you performed on this statewide writing 
test. A description of how papers are scored is printed on the left side 
of this report. A description of each possible score is printed on the 
back of this report. 
Remember, you were given 45 minutes to read the assigned topic. plan 
what to write, and then write your response. 
The conditions under 
which you write papers in class or at home may not be the same as 
those for this test: therefore, the writing may not be the same. You and 
your teachers should consider the score on this test along with all of 
your other writing when planning activities to continue developing 
your writing skills. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPIC: 
You were asked to persuade community leaders whether 
to set a weekend curfew.
