(II) 
a Transaction (as that term is defined in the 2005 ISDA Commodity 
Definitions (published by ISDA) (the "2005 Commodity Definitions")) will be 
deemed to incorporate the 2005 Commodity Definitions into the Confirmation

Transaction for the purpose of this Agreement whether or not a Confirmation 
of such a Transaction refers to this Agreement and irrespective of any 
reference in a Confirmation to the "International Bullion Master Agreement", 
the "LBMA", or the "IBMA", provided however, if a confirmation of any such 
transaction expressly states that another master agreement governs, such 
transaction will not be a Transaction for the purpose of this Agreement.

swap(s) but not cross currency interest rate swap(s). 
(ii) 
Section 1(b) of this Agreement is amended by adding the following 
proviso at the end thereof: "provided, however, that with respect to (i) an 
FX Transaction (other than one that is identified as non-deliverable in the 
relevant Confirmation) and (ii) a Transaction (which is confirmed using an 
electronic messaging system) (as each such transaction type is defined in 
this provision of the Schedule to this Agreement) this Agreement will 
prevail unless the relevant Confirmation specifically references this 
Agreement." 
(k) 
Disclosure. 
Each party hereby consents to the communication or 
disclosure by the other party of information in respect of or relating to 
this Agreement and any Transactions hereunder to such other party's 
branches, subsidiaries and Affiliates and, to the extent required by law or 
regulation, any government or regulatory authority.

Protocol including Annexes 1 - 18 inclusive published by the International

the parties had complied with the provisions of Section 2 of the Protocol. 
In this respect, references in the Protocol to an "ISDA 2002 Master 
Agreement" will be deemed to be references to this Agreement and the term 
"the parties", as used in the Protocol shall be construed as referring to 
Party A and Party B. 
(m) 
Master Representations. The representations set forth in Section 
3(a)(ii)-(iv) are hereby amended by adding to the end of each such sub-
section the following: ", provided that, solely to the extent made by Party 
A, this representation does not apply with respect to section 406 of ERISA, 
section 4975 of the Code, Governmental Plan Law, or Sections 731 or 764 of 
the Reform Act (or the statutory amendments enacted thereunder)."
