instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions 
can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other

the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current 
as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated 
with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest 
rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments 
(thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally 
lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause 
a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the 
higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside 
surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are 
among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to
