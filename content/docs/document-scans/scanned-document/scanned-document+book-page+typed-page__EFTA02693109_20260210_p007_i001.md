Figure 5. Neural regions that encoded cursor movement. (A) Scalp sensor contributions to the reconstruction of observed cursor velocity 
during the calibration phase. Mean (ti = 5) scalp maps of the sensors revealed a network of frontal, central and parietal involvement. In 
particular, sensors Fl. rcz and CPI-CP4 of the International 10/10 system made the largest contribution. Light and dark colors represent 
high and low contributors, respectively. Each scalp map with its percentage contribution is displayed above its associated 10 ms time lag. 
revealing the 12.4% maximal contribution of EEG data at 50 ms in the past. (B) Sources that maximally encoded observed cursor velocity 
during the calibration phase. We overlaid localized sources (yellow) from 50 ms in the past onto a model of the brain in different 
orientations to reveal the involvement of the PrG (I), PoG (2), LPM (3). STS (4), and dorsal and ventral LPC (5). (C) Scalp sensor 
contributions to the brain-controlled cursor velocity during the target acquisition phase. Mean (n = 5) scalp maps of the sensors weights 
from the subjects' best runs revealed a network that had shifted to involve more central regions than the network of the calibration phase. 
The scalp maps revealed a 12.1% maximal contribution of EEG data at 50 ms in the past. (D) Sources that maximally encoded 
brain-controlled cursor velocity during the target acquisition phase. Localized sources (yellow) from 50 ms in the past revealed a substantial 
involvement of PrG (I) and PoG (2) and some involvement of LPM (3). As in the calibration phase. the STS (4) was involved. In contrast to 
the calibration phase. the LPC (5) played a minor role, and the IPL (6) played a major role.

3.3. Neural regions that encoded cursor movement 
To visualize the contributions of scalp regions and current 
sources to the reconstruction of cursor velocity, the weights of 
the decoder were projected onto scalp maps. and sLORETA 
(Pascual-Marqui 2002) was employed. 
Scalp maps of 
sensor contributions to the reconstruction of observed cursor 
movements in the calibration phase depicted the contributions 
as a network of frontal, central and parietal regions 
6 
(figure 5(A)). Within this network, sensors over the 
frontocentral and primary sensorimotor cortices made the 
greatest contribution. Concerning time lags. EEG data from 
50 ms in the past supplied the most information. In source 
space at 50 ms in the past, the precentral gyms (PrG), 
postcentral gyms (PoG), lateral premotor (LPM) cortex, 
superior temporal sulcus (STS). and dorsal and ventral portions 
of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPC) played a large role in the 
encoding of observed cursor velocity (figure 5(B)). 
Scalp maps of sensor contributions to the brain-controlled 
cursor velocity were generated from the mean of each subject's 
best run in the target acquisition phase. They depicted the 
contributions as having shifted to be more focused within
