Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges:We use the Average Daly 
Balance methodto calculate Finance Charges on your Account. Under this method, we figure the Finance Charges on your 
Account by applying the daily pericdic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as describe
elow) for each feature (such as 
Purchase, Cash Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (inducing current transactions). To get the 
Average Daily Balance for each feature, we (1n take the beginning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid 
Finance Charges from previous billing periods), 2) add any new transactions, debts, or fees, (3) eu.btract any payments or 
credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustme s. For each day after the first day of the billing perroci, we Aso 
add an amount of interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the daily periodic rate 
for the feature. This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for 
the next day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the 
feature for the bang period and divide the total by the number of days in the biting period. This gives us the Average 
Daily Balance for the feature. For all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance 
wit be considered to be zero if you paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the 
Payment Due Date shown on that statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number 
of days in the baling period and the daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the Finance Charge 
assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge for the tilling period 
is calculated by adding the Finance Charges assessed on at features of the Account. This method of calculating the 
Average Daily Balance and Finance Charge results In daily compounding of Finance Charges. The minimum 
Finance Charge for any billing pared in which Finance Charges are imposed is 50.50.
