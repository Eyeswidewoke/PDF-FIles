SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
therefore, Deutsche Bank's and its affiliates' losses in the Master Fund and Feeder Funds 
will be limited to losses attributable to the ownership interests in the Master Fund and 
Feeder Funds held by Deutsche Bank and any affiliate in their capacities as investors in the 
Master Fund or Feeder Funds or as beneficiary of a restricted profit interest held by 
Deutsche Bank or any affiliate. 
AIFM Directive. The implementation of the AIFM Directive may have an adverse effect 
on certain aspects of the operation of the Master Fund and the Feeder Funds and the ability 
to market Interests to EU Investors. 
The AIFM Directive will apply in relation to any investment fund other than a fund 
authorized under the UCITS Directive (an "AIF'), including hedge funds, private equity 
funds, commodity funds, real estate funds, and infrastructure funds, and will apply to most 
managers of AIFs (each an "AIF Manager") established in the EU and to any AIF 
Managers established outside the EU who market their AlFs in the EU or manage AlFs 
established in the EU. 
The AIFM Directive provides, inter alia, that AIF Managers established in the EU must be 
authorized and regulated under the Directive in order to manage AIFs and AIF Managers 
established outside the EU must be authorized and regulated under the Directive in order to 
manage AlFs established in the EU. The Directive imposes new regulatory obligations on 
authorized AIF Managers in respect of their activities and the AIFs that they manage, and 
also regulates the marketing in the EU by AIF Managers (whether established in the EU or 
elsewhere) of AlFs (whether established in the EU or elsewhere). 
Neither the General Partner nor the Investment Manager is authorized under the AIFM 
Directive as of the date of this Memorandum, and the substantive requirements applicable 
to an authorized AIFM under the AIFM Directive are not applicable to the General Partner 
or the Investment Manager with respect to the Feeder Funds apart from certain specific 
requirements that may apply in certain EU countries as a result of the marketing of Interests 
to EU investors. 
However, the Master Fund is expected to be treated as an AIF established in the EU that is 
managed by an AIF Manager that is also established in the EU. Accordingly, the Master 
Fund Manager has applied for authorization in the United Kingdom by the FCA to the 
extent required under the AIFM Directive and its implementing legislation and as of the 
initial closing of the Master Fund expects to be authorized and regulated in the United 
Kingdom by the FCA thereunder. The Master Fund Manager will be the Master Fund's 
AIFM under the AIFM Directive and will assume responsibility, and be subject to all 
applicable requirements, as such. 
The application of the AIFM Directive with respect to the Master Fund and the Feeder 
Funds may have a material impact on certain aspects of the organization of the Master 
Fund and the Feeder Funds and their respective organizational and operating expenses, as 
more fully described in the Master Fund Offering Memorandum.
