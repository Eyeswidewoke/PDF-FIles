THE UNS-1D SYSTEMS RECEIVE BARO-CORRECTED ALTITUDE AND TAS INFORMATION FROM THE NO. 1 AND NO.2 AIR 
DATA COMPUTERS RESPECTIVELY, VOR/DME BEARING AND DISTANCE INFORMATION FROM THE NO. 1 AND NO.2 COLLINS 
VIR-432 AND DME-442 SYSTEMS. AND CROSS SIDE GPS INFORMATION AS WELL AS EACH UNITS INDEPENDENT GPS SENSOR 
DATA, FUEL FLOW DATA FROM THE AIRCRAFT FUEL FLOW SYSTEM AND IRS INFORMATION FROM THE EXISTING NO. I. 2. AND 
3 HONEYWELL "IASERREF SYSTEMS. THE UNS-ID FMS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED UNDER UNIVERSAL AVIONICS 
SYSTEMS CORP. FAA APPROVED STC SA5072NM, IN AN AIRCRAFT AND CERTIFIED FOR YEA AND IFR NAVIGATION WHICH 
QUALIFIES THIS INSTALLATION AS A "FOLLOW ON" INSTALLATION PER AC 20-130A 
THE UNS-ID EMS SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO MEET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF AC-20-130A FOR VFR-IFR 
NAVIGATION ENROUTE, TERMINAL, OVER WATER AND IN REMOTE AREAS, AND FOR NON-PRECISION APPROACHES. 
THE NO.1 AND 2 EMS SYSTEMS ARE DIGITALLY INTEGRATED TO THE EXISTING HONEYWELL FIVE-TUBE ELECTRONIC FLIGHT 
INSTRUMENT SYSTEM (EFTS). THE PILOT AND COPILOTS EFIS SYMBOL GENERATOR'S HAVE HONEYWELL SERVICE BULLETIN 
A21-2000-028 AND THE MULTI-FUNCTION GENERATOR HAS HONEYWELL SERVICE BULLETIN A21-2000429 TO INCORPORATE 
NON-PRECISION OPS SCALING VIA GAMA ARM 429 LPN INTERFACE WHICH MEETS REQUIREMENTS OF TSO C129A AND AC 
20-130A. 
THE EMS SYSTEMS ARB CROSS-COUPLED TO EITHER THE PILOT OR COPILOT EELS FOR DISPLAY AND NAVIGATION. THE EFTS 
CONVERTS THE DIGITAL TO ANALOG OUTPUTS AND PROVIDES ALL LATERAL STEERING TO THE AUTOPILOT AND FLIGHT 
DIRECTOR SYSTEM. VERTICAL NAVIGATION (VNAV) FROM EITHER EMS SYSTEM IS NOT DISPLAYED OR COUPLED IN THIS 
INSTALLATION. THE FOLLOWING REQUIRED ANNUNCIATORS FOR THE FMS SYSTEMS ARE DISPLAYED ON THE EFTS 
DISPLAYS:
