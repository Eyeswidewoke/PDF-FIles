(solely in relation to retaining ownership interests in, and/or sponsoring, 
a collaterized loan obligation vehicle that (i) was in place as of December 
31, 2813 and (ii) would be a "covered fund" as defined under the Volcker 
Rule) will be extended to July 21, 2017. The Issuer intends and expects not 
to be a "covered fund" as defined under the Volcker Rule and will be 
prohibited from acquiring any Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, Senior 
Secured Bonds, Senior Unsecured Bonds or Letters of Credit Reimbursement 
Obligations unless the Volcker Rule Condition has been satisfied. If, 
notwithstanding such intent and expectation, the Issuer is determined to be 
such a "covered fund", this would have a negative effect on the ability or 
desire of certain investors subject to the Volcker Rule to invest in or to 
continue to hold Notes. 
EU risk retention; decreased liquidity in respect of the Notes. Effective 
January 1, 2014, EU Regulation 575/2013 (the CRR) is expected to be 
implemented by national legislation or rulemaking in the other countries in 
the European Economic Area (EEA). CRR Articles 405-407 place certain 
conditions on investments in asset-backed securities by credit institutions 
and investment firms (together referred to as institutions) regulated in EEA 
countries and by affiliates of those institutions. CRR Article 405 requires 
such institutions not to invest in any securitization position (as defined 
in CRR) unless the sponsor, originator or original lender has disclosed to 
investors that it will retain a specified minimum net economic interest in 
the securitization transaction. Prior to investing in a securitization 
position, and on an ongoing basis thereafter, the regulated institution must 
also be able to demonstrate that it has a comprehensive and thorough 
understanding of the securitization transaction and its structural features 
by satisfying the due diligence requirements and ongoing monitoring 
obligations of CRR Article 406. Under CRR Article 407, an institution that 
fails to comply with the requirements of CRR Article 405 or 406 will be 
subject to an additional regulatory capital charge. Article 17 of AIFMD and 
Chapter III, Section 5 of the AIFM Regulation introduced risk retention and 
due diligence requirements (which took effect from July 22, 2013 in general) 
in respect of AIFMs that are required to become authorised under the AIFMD. 
While the requirements applicable to AIFMs under Chapter III, Section 5 of 
the AIFM Regulation are similar to those which apply to credit institutions 
and investment firms under CRR Articles 405-406, they are not identical and, 
in particular, additional due diligence obligations apply to AIFMs. 
Requirements similar to those set out in CRR Articles 405-406, AIFMD Article 
17 and Chapter III, Section 5 of the AIFM Regulation are expected to be 
implemented for other types of EU-regulated investors (such as insurance and 
reinsurance undertakings and UCITS funds) in the future. When implemented, 
such requirements may apply to investments in securities already issued, 
including the Notes. No originator, sponsor or original lender (including 
Barclays) will retain or commit to retain a material net economic interest 
with respect to the Notes or the Collateral Obligations or to provide any 
additional information that may be required to enable a credit institution, 
investment firm, alternative investment manager, insurance or reinsurance 
undertaking or other investor to satisfy the due diligence and monitoring 
requirements of CRR Articles 404-410, AIFMD Article 17 and Chapter III, 
Section 5 of the AIFM Regulation or any corresponding rules applicable to
