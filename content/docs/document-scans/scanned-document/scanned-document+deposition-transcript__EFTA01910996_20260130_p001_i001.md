St. Berths 
Had lunch on Rising Sun with David Geffen today. He is so smart, knows 
everything about entertainment and such a joy to talk to. 
Do NOT think less of me....I am going to Ghislaine's birthday dinner on a boat 
called "Akula" tonight because I have nothing else to do. Will report back...in 
detail. Boat is next to "Rising Sun". 
So far I am having a terrific time. The Tiawana is filled with young Park Avenue 
Jewish rich couples with little kids. 
It looks like the Eden Roc/Fountain Blue 
of Miami 60 years ago when my parents would take us on xmass vacation. 
I have hung out at Aby Rosen's beach front house for breakfast, lunch and 
dinner...and Larry Gagosian (has house next door) is also at Aby's. Larry has a 
hot dinner Sat., Dec. 29...want to come? This beach is action central...as is 
the harbor. 
Moving to Austin's new catamaran sailboat tomorrow for dec. 26 to noon on 
29th...to save 2,000 Euro a day. I went to see it yesterday...it's a racing boat, 
very cool and I am dreading it. Leaving all my clothes at Tiawana and taking a 
bathing suit and toothbrush. 
Paid for 22-26 myself..and it's more than I can afford. 
Austin has rented the entire penthouse from 29-Jan. 6 and I am on his plan 
then...in exchange for getting him invited everywhere or just providing a life 
for him and the future 5th Mrs. Hearst. 
Dasha and Roman Abramovich invited me and Austin for New Year's Eve...that alone 
is worth paying for my room. 
I am free on the 27th 
and anytime from Jan. 1-5th to see you. 
Would you come here for a day? 
I am sure you have 20 nobel prize winners eating your froi gras and cavier... 
This new assistant Jenna Freidman...27 year old pretty miami go getter is 
sansational. We were on the phone for two hours today. She is sending from me 
15 letters to filmmakers to request to see their films before, during or after 
Sundance and work on them. She knows all the studio people and many filmmakers 
....and is also a good writer and helping on the Mercedes 250,000-500,000 a year 
film series sponsorship proposal... A job we have. 
She is smart, nice, very willing and open...beyond thrilled moody nasty Darin is 
gone. 
We are doing all this work on my gmail account so Bryan can not read a thing...if 
he thinks he is backing Darin to go into business against me...that's a really 
good reason to call the lawyers asap. I am staying calm and doing all this 
ground work for new business of all the young independent films over the 
vacation. Bryan's insane remarks are this Independent business is something not 
for me and I am not interested in. 
I don't know what he expects me to do from 
Jan. to Sept...but he is nuts. He helped Darin develope this business under my 
name and believe me...this business is staying with my company. 
Sony already 
asked if they should give business to Darin and I said "no". 
I will do the same with every other studio in town...independent or major.
