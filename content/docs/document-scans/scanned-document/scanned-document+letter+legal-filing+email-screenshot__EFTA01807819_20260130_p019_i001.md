United States: Continue =o monitor developments following court ruling temporarily blocking new =mmigration 
restrictions 
Level: Advisory 
Location: United =tates; 
Category: Entry restrictions 
Members intending to travel to or from the US should continue =o closely monitor developments linked to a recent 
Executive Order =etailing new immigration procedures. A federal judge in Hawaii state on =5 March approved a 
nationwide temporary restraining order against =ravel restrictions within the Order, hours before the measure was to 
=ome into effect on 16 March. A similar ruling was subsequently issued =y a federal judge in Maryland state. The rulings 
will prevent the =arious restrictions in the Order from being implemented at least until =egal challenges against the law 
are adjudicated at an as yet =nspecified date. 
Advice 
• 
Despite the =emporary stay, travellers from the affected countries should continue =o consult the relevant US 
diplomatic mission for more information on =he temporary restrictions and anticipate possible additional screening 
=easures on a case-by-case basis when travelling to the US. 
• 
Nationals from countries not listed above are currently not =ffected by the Executive Order; however, the Order 
states that further =ountries may be added to the list of those affected by restrictions in =he future. Monitor relevant 
developments in the coming weeks and =onths. 
• 
We do not hold information on specific =lights. Should related demonstrations occur at airports in the =hort-
term, we do not expect they will affect flight schedules. However, =n the case of protests, travellers should contact the 
relevant airline, =ravel agent or the airport's website directly to reconfirm the status =f flights prior to setting out. 
• 
Monitor our alerts =n the US for further developments. 
More detail 
The Executive Order, signed =n 6 March by President Donald Trump, originally set out, among other =hings, to impose a 
90-day restriction on citizens of Iran, Libya, =omalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from applying for visas to travel to the =S. 
However, the latest judicial rulings mean these citizens will be =ermitted in the interim to continue applying for visas 
and undertaking =ravel to the US with valid travel documents. 
Even =rior to the temporary judicial stay, the Order's restrictions would not =ave affected citizens of the aforementioned 
countries with valid US =isas, those who already hold legal permanent residence in the US (green =ard), and dual 
nationals travelling on a passport from a non-restricted =ountry. The Executive Order would have also attempted to bar 
refugees =rom entering the US for 120 days and caps the number of refugees =dmitted at 50,000 per year. 
The new Executive Order =as drafted in response to a previous temporary judicial stay on a =imilar but distinct measure 
issued on 27 January, which included a =0-day restriction on the entry of Iraqi, Iranian, Libyan, Somali, =udanese, Syrian 
and Yemeni nationals to the US, as well as the =rohibition of all refugees from entering the country for 120 days. The 
=ew Executive Order would have recalled the previous order entirely and =eplaced it. 
The primary differences between the =revious Order and the new one include the removal of Iraq from the list =f 
countries explicitly affected by travel restrictions, and the =xemption from restrictions of individuals who as of 16 March
