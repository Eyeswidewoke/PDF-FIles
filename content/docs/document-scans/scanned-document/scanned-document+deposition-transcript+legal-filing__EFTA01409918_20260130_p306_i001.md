Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE 
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common 
stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the 
public market could reduce prevailing market prices. Some shares will not be 
available for sale shortly after this offering because of contractual and 
legal restrictions on sale as described below. Sales of substantial amounts 
of our common stock in the United States or Canadian public market 
after any of these restrictions on sale lapse could adversely affect the 
prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise 
equity capital in the future. 
Upon the completion of this offering, 27,253,018 shares of our common stock 
will be outstanding (or 27,914,782 shares if the underwriters 
exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). All shares of 
common stock sold in this offering, other than up to 220,588 shares to be 
sold in our directed share program that are subject to lock-up agreements, 
will be freely tradable in the United States, without restriction or 
registration under the Securities Act unless they are purchased by our 
"affiliates" as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, 
or by 
persons who are subject to the lock-up agreements described below to the 
extent sales of such shares are prohibited by the terms of such lock-up 
agreements. All remaining shares were issued and sold by us in private 
transactions and are eligible for public sale in the United States if 
registered 
under the Securities Act or sold in accordance with Rule 144 or Rule 701 
under the Securities Act. These remaining shares are "restricted 
securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 
Restricted securities may be sold in the public market in the United States 
only 
if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under 
Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, as summarized below. 
As a result of contractual lock-up agreements with us or the underwriters as 
described below, and subject to the provisions of Rules 144 and 
701 under the Securities Act described below, these restricted securities 
will be available for sale in the public market set forth below. 
Lock-Up Agreements 
We, our directors, officers and holders of approximately 99% of our 
outstanding common stock, have entered into contractual lock-up 
agreements with representatives of the underwriters, pursuant to which, 
subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 180 days following the date of 
this prospectus, we and our directors, officers and such stockholders will 
not offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge or contract to sell or otherwise 
dispose of or hedge any shares of our common stock or any securities 
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock or publicly 
announce an intention to do any of the foregoing without the prior written 
consent of Jefferies LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. Jefferies LLC 
and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, in their sole discretion, at any time and 
without prior notice, may release all or any portion of the shares from the 
restrictions contained in any such lock-up agreements.
