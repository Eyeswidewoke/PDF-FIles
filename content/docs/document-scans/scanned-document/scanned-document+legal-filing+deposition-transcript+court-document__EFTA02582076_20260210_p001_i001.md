When I was 8 years old, I watched my trial-lawyer father play Horace Vandergelder in the Livingston, N.J., community-
theater production of "Hello, Dolly!" He entered wearing an enormous marching-band ba=s drum (the character is in a 
parade), and he roared to his sobbing niece, "Dammit! How am I supposed to play 'Yonkers My Yonkers' w=th all that 
bellowing in my ears!" It was the most exciting thing I had ever seen= 
I was a melancholic child. Worried, anxious. I never felt as if I belonged anywhere, as if I were a foreign exchange 
student living among the other kids, who seemed predestined to love sports. Add to that alienation the fact that my 
parents were going through a divorce, and I was truly treading water. But in that junior high school auditorium, I felt like 
I'd discovered a secret I didn't even know was being=20 whispered. There was a place where I might belong: It was the 
Theater, and I was sold. 
A few years later= at St=gedoor Manor <http://=ww.nytimes.com/1987/07/04/style/where-the-campers-strut-and-fret-
a-little.=tml?action=click&module=Search&region=searchResults&> in Loch Sheldrake, N.Y., I joined an intensive 
theater bo=t camp for kids just like me. The second I stepped off the bus, I felt like baby Simba when he's lifted into the 
air in "The Lion King" and all =he animals sing. Everyone was affectionate; everyone hugged; no was called "gay&=dquo; 
for doing anything that wasn't masculine. (My insecurity about this h=d shamefully kept me from doing theater in 
school.) It was utopia, and I never wanted to leave.

It was there I met Michael Larsen, the musical director of the camp. He told me that I wasn't just a camper having fun, 
but that I also had=20 talent. And he was tough — sometimes he'd scream at me — =ut I knew it was because he 
thought I had a shot. (Michael was the first of many gay men instrumental in guiding me to where I am now, which is 
why I try to speak on behalf of gay rights whenever I can. But I suppose that's a=20 different essay.) 
At 18, I was cast as Woody Allen and Diane Keaton's son in =he film "Manhattan Murder Mystery," 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch=v=MZA)224bAS8> my first movi= role. And now, after studying film and theater at 
Northwestern University= playing J. D. on "Scrubs" 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/arts/television/09rhod.html?sc==5&sq=scrubs+nbc&st=nyt&action=click&modu 
Ie=Sear=h&region=searchResults&> on TV for nine years and directing two films, I'm working with Woody=20 Allen 
again. I'm typing these words in my dressing room at the St. Ja=es Theater, where on April 10 I'll open in "Bullets Over 
Broadway=" a musical adaptation of his hit film <http://www.=outube.com/watch?v=6BDr_955ZwU> . I play David 
Shayne, a struggling writer in 1929 New York who agrees to cast a mobster's ditsy girlfriend in one of his plays in order 
to ge= it produced. 
The St. James is where Yul Brynner opened in "The King and I" in 1=51; where hits like "Oklahomal," "The Pajama 
Game," &Id=uo;Gypsy," "The Who's Tommy," and "The Producers" played, and where, in 1964, b= the most surreal of 
coincidences, Carol Channing first descended an endless staircase in "Hello, Dolly!" I sit in Dressing Room 201, where 
=any of the great luminaries of the Broadway stage — Patti LuPone, Nathan Lan=, Mandy Patinkin — have paced waiting 
for the intercom to chime, &Idquo=Places for Act I, please." This is the sanctuary that a little invisible boy=in New Jersey 
dreamed he'd one day find.
