frame of reference. 
Long ago and far away there was a gamma ray burst. In it there was an event, E, where an 
atom emitted two gamma rays, yt and 72, both moving in the positive x direction, which we take 
to be oriented towards the Earth, with energies Et and E2. We will assume that E2 » 
El. The 
coordinates of the event 6 in Alice's frame are Ea = (t, x) = (—L/c, —L). We assume that the speed 
of a photon is given by (1). 
Alice has a photon detector at the origin of her coordinates. It consists of a device which 
amplifies the effect of a photon scattering from an electron. It then contains some electrons, which 
are passing though the detector, and can be considered to be moving slowly. At a time t = 0, on her 
clock, the first photon encounters an electron in her detector. This detection event, F1 then occurs 
at coordinates yr 
(0, 0) in her frame. At a later timer the second photon arrives and encounters 
an electron which is just passing through the detector at that time, which is also amplified. This is 
the second detection event F2 which occurs at coordinates .F3 = 
0) in her framer. 
It is easy to compute that

We now consider how this experiment is described in a frame of an observer, called Bob, who 
is in a satellite which passes by Alice with a velocity v at the time t = 0. Let us call this Bob's 
frame of reference2. We then put the origin of Bob's frame so that the event IT = (0, 0) in Alice's 
frame has the coordinates yr, 
(0, 0) in Bob's frame. This implies that the coordinates of events 
in Bob's frame are found by making a passive lorentz transformation at the event F1. 
2.1 Description of the experiment in the K-Poincare framework 
To define the lorentz transformation to Bob's frame we work in n-Minkowski spacetime[19, 20, 21, 
23, 24). In this framework the Lie algebra of the Poincare group is deformed to a quantum algebra 
called the n-Poincare algebra. This is to allow the time and space coordinate to fail to commute, 
[xi. t] = tart'' 
(3) 
This can be further seen as a consequence of a postulate the momentum space is curved. 
A feature of n-Minkowski spacetime is that the tt-Poincare algebra is non-linear and has a non-
linear action on coordinates. Consequently, one has some freedom in defining what quantities in 
the phase space of a free relativistic particle correspond to physical spacetime coordinates, physi-
cal momentum and physical energy, as would be measured by macroscopic detectors. Some argue 
that physics should be invariant under these choices, while others argue that a single choice is cor-
rect. Because this issue is not resolved we will study here two hypotheses. The first is that particles 
propagate along worldlines defined in the non-commuting coordinates (xi ,t). It has been argued 
that worldlines defined in these coordinates have an energy-independent speed of light[21, 23, 24]. 
Nonetheless we will see that there are issues with apparent non-localities or coordinate ambigui-
ties. 
'To facilitate comparison with [6], we note that these coordinates are shifted slightly from those used there; in that 
reference fl = (0,0) while Yr a (-7,0). As the shift is already of order tpL, this does not affect the conclusions of the 
analysis to leading order in tpL. 
2In 161 this is called the satellite frame.
