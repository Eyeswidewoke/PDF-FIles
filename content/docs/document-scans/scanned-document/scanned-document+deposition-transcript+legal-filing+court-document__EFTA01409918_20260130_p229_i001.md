contribution margin of 32.5%. Since 2007, our new restaurants that have been 
open at least three years as of December 28, 2014, have generated an 
average year three cash-on-cash return of greater than 50%. We calculate our 
year three cash-on-cash return by dividing our restaurant contribution 
in the third year of operation by our initial investment costs (net of pre-
opening costs and tenant allowances). Our restaurants perform well across a 
diverse range of geographic regions, population densities and real estate 
settings, which we believe demonstrates the portability of our concept to 
new markets. We believe the combination of our strong cash-on-cash returns, 
proven concept portability, and footprint of only 37 restaurants, 
including our first joint venture restaurant, supports further use of cash 
flow to grow our restaurant base and creates an attractive new restaurant 
growth opportunity. 
Highly Attractive Concept for Domestic and International Real Estate 
Developers Supports Growth 
Due to the broad appeal of our brand, the diversity of our guest base and 
the relatively high number of weekly visits to our restaurants, our 
concept is a preferred tenant for real estate developers. Landlords and 
developers, both in the United States and internationally, seek out our 
restaurants to be anchors for their developments as they are highly 
complementary to national retailers. Our restaurants that opened prior to 
Fiscal 
2014 have attracted, on average, approximately 137,000 guests per restaurant 
in Fiscal 2014, which we believe, based on an internal survey of our 
public fine-dining competitors, is approximately 60% more guests per 
restaurant than those competitors. Our ability to achieve AUVs that are 
comparable to those of other high-end steakhouses despite our lower average 
check demonstrates our capacity to attract more guests than many of 
our competitors. Our AUVs, brand recognition and relatively high guest 
traffic position us well to negotiate the prime location within a 
development and favorable lease terms, which enhance our return on invested 
capital 
We believe our concept has international appeal and makes us an attractive 
tenant for international real estate developers, and we believe we 
will be able to leverage our brand strength to negotiate attractive terms in 
desirable locations as we grow outside the United States and Brazil. 
Experienced Leadership 
Our senior management team has extensive operating experience with an 
average of over 26 years of experience in the restaurant industry. We 
are led by our CEO, Larry Johnson. Mr. Johnson first began working with Fogo 
de Chao in 1996 as Corporate Counsel. In 2007, Mr. Johnson 
joined us as CEO and has guided the growth of our company from 11 
restaurants in 2007 to 37 restaurants as of the date of this prospectus. 
Under 
his leadership, our business has consistently achieved growth in revenue and 
Adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. Mr. Johnson leads a team of 
dedicated, experienced restaurant professionals including Barry McGowan, our 
President, Tony Laday, our CFO, and Selma Oliveira, our COO. 
Mrs. Oliveira, who was born in Brazil, joined us to help start our
