does not necessarily solve the problem. Seemingly "sexual" behaviors (i.e., vagi-
nal or anal intercourse) can be in the service of nonsexual needs and may, in fact, 
be more motivated by power and/or anger. This is why it is often said that rape, a 
crime involving obvious sexual activity, is not a sex crime but a crime of violence. 
Obviously such acts may still be considered sexual assaults by the law even if they 
were motivated by nonsexual needs. 
Sex can also include deviant sexual acts involving behavior such as sadomas-
ochism, bondage, urination, and defecation. A sexual act for one person might 
not be a sexual act for another, or it might not be illegal. Some would argue, 
therefore, that a sex crime is one motivated by sexual gratification. 
Some acts can be sexual acts if you can prove the intent or motivation of the 
individual. Are kissing, hugging, or appearing naked in front of a child sexual 
acts? Are giving a child an enema, taking a child's rectal temperature, having a 
child spit in a cup, or cutting a child's hair sexual acts? Are a physical examination 
by a doctor, hands-on wrestling instructions by a coach, or photographing a child 
playing dead sexual acts? It is common for child molesters when interviewed to 
admit their acts but deny the intent (i.e., "I was demonstrating a wrestling hold 
with the child." "I was taking measurements for a study on adolescent growth." 
"It was part of an initiation ceremony."). All these acts could be sexual acts if you 
could prove the intent was for sexual gratification. Seemingly "nonsexual" 
behavior can be in the service of sexual needs. 
How does an investigator prove intent or motivation? Can a crime have more 
than one motivation? Can we determine motivation from the offender? We know 
that offenders are more reluctant to admit sexual motives than other types of 
motives (i.e., profit, revenge, anger, power). Does the offender always know his 
motivation? Potential ways to address this problem will be discussed later in this 
publication. 
It is important for investigators to realize that some acts may not be crimes 
even if they can prove they were done for sexual gratification. Photographing 
children on the playground, tape recording the belching of boys, or listening to 
children urinate in a public bathroom can be sexual acts for some individuals, but 
they are most likely not crimes. 
Other acts involve societal and cultural judgments. Do allowing children to 
watch adults have sex or gain access to pornography constitute child sexual abuse 
or child neglect? Should artists, photographers, and therapists have special privi-
leges under child-pornography statutes? Can a high-quality artistic photograph 
taken with an expensive camera and printed on expensive paper still be child 
pornography? Is it child abuse to ask a child to reenact sexual abuse the child has 
described? Is it a crime to photograph the reenactment? Is bunting a child's geni-
tals with a lit cigarette physical abuse, sexual abuse, or both? Does it ever matter? 
Yes, the specific motivation might have important investigative or prosecutive 
significance in some cases. 
Investigators and prosecutors obviously must look to the law to determine 
what is a sex offense and the elements of the offense. Some states allow wider 
latitude in looking at motivation to determine what is a sex crime. In any case, 
when evaluating the significance and relevance of offender behavior and 
children's allegations, investigators should always consider both the activity 
and its motivation.
