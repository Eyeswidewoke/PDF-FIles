good order, repair and condition, (e) has been installed and operates properly, and (f) is subject to all of

therein are in all of the foregoing respects satisfactory to Borrower, and Borrower shall not assert any 
claim of any nature whatsoever against Lender based on any of the foregoing matters; provided, 
however, that nothing contained herein shall in any way bar, reduce or defeat any claim that Borrower

and conditions herein.

service and repair the Equipment, and maintain all records and other materials relating thereto, (A) in 
accordance and consistent with (1) the supplier's or manufacturer's recommendations all maintenance 
and operating manuals or service agreements, whenever furnished or entered into, including any 
subsequent amendments or replacements thereof, issued by the supplier or manufacturer thereof or other 
service provider (including requiring all components, fuels and fluids installed in or used on the Equipment 
to meet the standards specified by such service provider from time to time), (2) the requirements of all

a Security interest in favor of "FIFTH THIRD BANK" or such other words designated by Lender on labels 
furnished by Lender. If the location for any Equipment comprising collateral for the Loan is a facility 
leased by Borrower or owned by Borrower subject to one or more mortgage liens, upon the request of 
Lender, Borrower will obtain a real property waiver or waivers in form and substance satisfactory to 
Lender from the lenders or mortgagees of such facility.
