Who Helped Snowden Steal State Secrets? 
By Edward Jay Epstein 
In March 2013, when Edward Snowden sought a job with Booz Allen =amilton at a National Security Agency facility in 
Hawaii, he signed =he requisite classified-information agreements and would have been =ade well aware of the law 
regarding communications intelligence. 
Section 798 of the United States Code makes it a federal crime if a =erson "knowingly and willfully communicates, 
furnishes, transmits, or =therwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or =ses in any manner 
prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United =tates" any classified information concerning communication 
=ntelligence. 
Mr. Snowden took that position so he could arrange to have published =lassified communications intelligence, as he told 
the South China =orning Post earlier this month. The point of Mr. Snowden's penetration =as to get classified data from 
the NSA. He subsequently stated: "My =osition with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of =achines all over 
the world the NSA hacked, that is why I accepted that =osition." 
My question would be, then: Was he alone in this enterprise to =isappropriate communications intelligence? 
Before taking the job in Hawaii, Mr. Snowden was in contact with people =ho would later help arrange the publication of 
the material he =urloined. Two of these individuals, filmmaker Laura Poitras and =uardian blogger Glenn Greenwald, 
were on the Board of the Freedom of =he Press Foundation that, among other things, funds WikiLeaks. 
In January 2013, according to the Washington Post, Mr. Snowden =equested that Ms. Poitras get an encryption key for 
Skype so that they =ould have a secure channel over which to communicate. 
In February, he made a similar request to Mr. Greenwald, providing him =ith a step-by-step video on how to set up 
encrypted communications. 
So, before Mr. Snowden proceeded with his NSA penetration in March 2013 =hrough his Booz Allen Hamilton job, he 
had assistance, either =ittingly or unwittingly, in arranging the secure channel of encrypted =ommunications that he 
would use to facilitate the publication of =lassified communications intelligence. 
On May 20, three months into his job, Mr. Snowden falsely claimed to =is employer that he needed treatment for 
epilepsy. The purpose of the =over story was to conceal his trip to Hong Kong, where the operation =o steal U.S. secrets 
would be brought to fruition. 
Mr. Greenwald and Ms. Poitras also flew to Hong Kong. They were later =oined by Sarah Harrison, a Wikileaks 
representative who works closely =ith Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder. Mr. Snowden reportedly =rought the 
misappropriated data to Hong Kong on four laptops and a =humb drive. He gave some of the communications 
intelligence to Mr. =reenwald, who had arranged to publish it in the Guardian, and Mr. =nowden arranged to have Ms. 
Poitras make a video of him issuing a =tatement that would be released on the Guardian's website. Albert Ho, = Hong 
Kong lawyer, was retained to deal with Hong Kong authorities. 
This orchestration did not occur in a vacuum. Airfares, hotel bills and =ther expenses over this period had to be paid. A 
safe house had to be =ecured in Hong Kong. Lawyers had to be retained, and safe passage to =oscow—a trip on which 
Mr. Snowden was accompanied by WikiLeaks' =arah Harrison—had to be organized. 
The world now knows that the misappropriation of U.S. communications =ntelligence began appearing in the Guardian 
and other publications on =une 5, and Mr. Snowden left Hong Kong for the Moscow airport on June =1. A question that 
remains to be answered: Who, if anyone, aided and =betted this well-planned theft of U.S. secrets? 
Mr. Epstein's most recent book is "The Annals of Unsolved Crime" =ublished in March by Melville House.
