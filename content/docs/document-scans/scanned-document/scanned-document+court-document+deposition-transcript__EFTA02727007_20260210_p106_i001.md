Upon a review of the log book, it was indicated Mr. EPSTEIN has been speaking to the inmate companions bout 
having previously taught mathematics and physics. He has been observed pacing the cell as well as sleeping, eating, 
and drinking within normal limits. 
Upon interview today, Mr. EPSTEIN requested he be provided a toothbrush as well as a shower. His requests were 
made known to the lieutenants and he was provided a shower prior to attending his legal visit. This writer also provided 
him a toothbrush, toothpaste, and hygiene products. 
Asked about the alleged incident which transpired yesterday resulting in his placement on Suicide Watch, Mr. EPSTEIN 
said he is frustrated he has been placed in a "punishment cell for no reason." Specifically, Mr. EPSTEIN was referring 
to his placement in the SHU. Asked to recall the events surrounding the alleged incident, Mr. EPSTEIN said his cell 
mate was "playing with a bed sheet" and he claimed he does not recall the events thereafter. He said he recalled eating 
meat and drinking water and claimed the next event for which he has memory is his hearing himself snore acrd waking 
up on a stretcher. 
Mr. EPSTEIN claimed he does not recall himself or his cell mate tying a string or rope around his neck. He said he has 
"been trying to remember and "wracking his mind." Asked if he experienced any interpersonal issues with his cell 
mate. Mr. EPSTEIN described his cell mate as "agitated" and claimed his cell mate called him a "pedophile" for the first 
time yesterday. His cell mate was also reportedly reading a newspaper article about Mr. EPSTEIN, which bothered him 
and it was something he believed to be "strange" for their to be an article about him in his cell. Mr. EPSTEIN recalled 
throwing away the newspaper photograph of himself by crumpling it and flushing it down the toilet. Asked if his cell 
mate ever threatened to harm him, he denied this to be the case. Asked why he told the inmate companions yesterday 
his cell mate tried to kill him, while also claiming no memory of the incident, Mr. EPSTEIN again said he did not recall 
the incident and further stated, "I don't know if he put it there as a joke." Mr. EPSTEIN explained he had been 
experiencing difficulty sleeping in his SHU cell due to his inmate peers banging on the cell door and window,. but has not 
been experiencing any other acute issues other than this. 
Reason for Removal from Watch 
Mr. EPSTEIN stated, "I have no interest in killing myself." He explained although his situation is "not perfect" due to his 
being incarcerated, he noted he has "lots to do for [his] legal case." He described having a "wonderful life," to include 
interactions with "interesting people and projects." He said "it would be crazy" to take his life. He furthered, "I would not 
do that to myself." Mr. EPSTEIN did express a feeling of safety being housed on Psychological Observation rather than 
in the SHU. He asked if he could remain on this status for a couple of days, he was advised his housing situation will be 
re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. He expressed a desire to be housed in general population rather than in the SHU 
and asked if there were a "safer unit for him to be housed in comparison to the one where he was initially placed. Mr. 
EPSTEIN claimed there were many MS-13 gang members on the initial unit. He was advised he will be maintained on 
Psychological Observation in the near future, but his long-term housing situation will be revisited, as it is not Ideal for 
one to remain in isolation on Psychological Observation for extended periods of time. Mr. EPSTEIN acknowledged this 
information and thanked this writer for her explanation and time.
