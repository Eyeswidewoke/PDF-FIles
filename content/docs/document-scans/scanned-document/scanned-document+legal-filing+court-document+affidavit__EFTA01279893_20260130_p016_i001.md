of the Building. No Owner shall be entitled to penetrate the roof of the Building without first 
providing detailed plans and specifications for the reason of any such penetration to the 
Association and obtaining prior written approval from the Association and, if applicable, the 
Mixed Use Owner. The Association shall have the right to approve any contractors working on 
the roof of the Building or any other Common Elements. Owners shall not be entitled to make 
any changes, alterations or revisions to the Common Elements without prior written approval 
from the Association. 
Section 7.16 
Satellite Dishes and Antennas. 
Unless otherwise required by law, no 
exterior satellite dish in excess of one meter in diameter may be placed on the exterior of any Unit 
or in the Common Elements without the prior written approval of the Executive Board, which 
may be withheld in its sole discretion. The location of any exterior television antenna, or satellite 
dish less than one meter in diameter, shall be subject to the reasonable prior approval of the 
Executive Board, taking into account the appropriate standards set forth in the regulations of the 
Federal Communications Commission, and to the extent reasonably practical, the Executive 
Board may require that such antenna or satellite dish be screened from public view. Prior to 
installing the antenna or satellite dish, the Owner shall furnish to the Executive Board a copy of 
his installation plans. The Association shall have the right to perform any portion of the 
installation work at the expense of the Owner, or to require that any portion of the work be 
performed by contractors designated by the Executive Board. In no event shall such antenna or 
satellite dish be installed on the roof unless required by law or otherwise approved by the 
Executive Board in its sole discretion, and then, any roof penetration that is required to install any 
antenna or satellite dish shall be performed only by the roofing contractor designated by the 
Executive Board. The Owner shall also be responsible for any damage caused by the removal of 
the antenna or satellite dish, including the sealing of conduits or other roof penetrations. Any 
Owner installing an antenna or satellite dish under this Section 7.16 shall indemnify, defend and 
hold the Association harmless from and against any loss, damage, claim or other liability resulting 
from the installation, maintenance, repair, use and/or removal of the antenna or satellite dish, 
including any damage to the roof of the Building or other property damage caused by roof leaks. 
Section 7.17 Exterior Terraces and Balconies. 
The exterior terraces and balconies 
adjacent to certain Units shall be kept in a clean, neat, and orderly condition at all times, and shall 
not be used for the overnight storage of garbage, or for the drying of laundry. In particular, 
towels or banners shall not be hung on the railings, and any dead plants shall be removed 
promptly. No indoor-outdoor carpeting, hot tub, or other pool shall be installed on any balcony or 
terrace. If permitted by applicable building codes and zoning ordinances, an Owner may use or 
store a cooking grill on his exterior ten-ace, but such Owner shall be responsible for complying 
with all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations in connection with such storage and use and 
any rules and regulations promulgated by the Association.
