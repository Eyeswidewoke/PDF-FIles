Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
In the ordinary course of their business activities, our Sponsor and its 
affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with 
our interests or those of our stockholders. Our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation will provide that none of our Sponsor, any of 
its 
affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-
employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and 
officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain 
from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or 
similar 
business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Our Sponsor 
also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to 
our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be 
available to us. In addition, our Sponsor may have an interest in pursuing 
acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, 
could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve 
risks to you. 
We will incur increased costs and become subject to additional regulations 
and requirements as a result of becoming a newly public company, 
and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new 
compliance matters, which could lower our profits or make it more 
difficult to run our business. 
As a newly public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and 
other expenses that we have not incurred as a private 
company, including costs associated with public company reporting 
requirements and costs of recruiting and retaining non-executive directors. 
We 
also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act and related rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, or the SEC, and NASDAQ. The expenses incurred by public 
companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes 
have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our 
legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more 
time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate 
these costs with any degree of certainty. Our management will need to 
devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of 
these requirements. These laws and regulations also could make it more 
difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including 
director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept 
reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to 
obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also 
make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to 
serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as our executive 
officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a 
public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, 
sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation. 
There may not be an active trading market for shares of our common stock, 
which may cause shares of our common stock to trade at a discount 
from the initial offering price and make it difficult to sell the shares of
