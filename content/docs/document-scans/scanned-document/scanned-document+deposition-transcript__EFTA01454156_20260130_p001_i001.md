of private equity and venture capital will be encouraged to support 
SMEs and newly-emerging industries. 
we believe that such reforms will substantially help to improve financial 
stability and capital allocation in China. According to CSRC, 42.3% of 
financing in China belonged to the direct-financing category by end of 2012, 
lower than that of developed economies like the US (87.2%), Japan (74.4%), 
Germany (69.2%) and emerging markets like India (66.7%) and Indonesia 
(66.3%). As a result, risks are highly concentrated in banking system. And 
financing is expensive and hard to access for small borrowers. we expect that 
the reforms of promoting direct-financing will help enrich the investment 
channels for individuals and corporate, disperse risk in financial system, 
meet financing needs of SMEs and lower the funding cost for them. 
under such endeavor, china capital markets will be much more diverse, 
structured and transparent in the future, and will a) mobilize massive 
private savings; b) encourage inward portfolio flows; and c) lift market 
sentiment and valuation. 
Promoting mixed ownership reform 
Echoing the on-going SOE reform, the statement said to "actively" develop a 
mixed ownership economy, to improve the modern enterprise system and 
corporate governance structure, and to promote equity transfer. Specifically, 
it encouraged the employee stock ownership as well as M&A among companies of 
different ownership. Entry barrier and acquisition restriction on private 
companies will be further removed. 
In our view, the mixed ownership reform is the key for China reform package 
on corporate level, which will help enhance SOEs' performance, unleash 
potential of private companies, better allocate resources as well as boost 
economic potential growth. According to our calculation, by Feb 2014, 62% of 
all Chinese listcos' market cap was SOEs either central or local ones, while 
private-owned only accounted for 38%. Among listed SOEs, 54% operated in 
monopolized sectors like oil & gas, banking, telecom and transportation, 42% 
operated in competitive sectors like food & beverage, auto, equipment, etc. 
Going forward, we expect 1) more monopolized central SOEs, in oil & gas, 
telecom and transportation, to open up for private capital investment with 
minority shares; 2) large chunk of local SOE shares in competitive sectors 
like F66, apparel, electrics and healthcare will be taken over by private 
capitals; 3) more local SoEs assets to be listed or injected into listcos. 
More details of this reform will be elaborated in the upcoming SOE reform 
plan. 
managing a balance between innovation, development and financial risk 
prevention 
while encouraging the innovation and modernization in China capital market, 
the authorities still keep the financial stability as paramount. Risk 
control, monitoring, reporting and disposal will go side by side with 
financial market evolvement. And most importantly, the bottom line of "no 
systemic or regional risk" will be firmly held, as per the Guideline. The 
policy also requires good management on the relationships of market vs. 
government, and investors at their own risk vs. investor protection. 
Investors should have a rational investment principle, awareness of risks, 
responsible for their actions and self-protection ability. Regulators will 
provide investors, especially small investors, the rights to know, to 
participate, to appeal and to supervise. 
The statement is in line with the "orderly default" concept proposed by 
regulators in regard of trust market and other shadow banking market risk.
