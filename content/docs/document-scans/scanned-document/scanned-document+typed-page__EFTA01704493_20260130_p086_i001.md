Make Your Next Dinner Out Even More Rewarding 
American Express is pleased to present the Passport to Dining 
program. You can earn a prepaid Dining Out Card worth $100 when 
you use your American Express® Card from September 20 through 
November 30, 2006 at four or more participating San Francisco 
restaurants and your receipts add up to at least $400. Using your 
Card helps local AIDS organizations, too. American Express will 
donate 5% of each American Express transaction at participating 
restaurants--up to $50,000 in total--to the Macy's Passport 2006 AIDS 
Organizations. The more of these restaurants you enjoy, the sooner 
you can earn your reward and the more funds you'll help raise for 
HIV/AIDS research, education and patient care. 
Why not start dining out 
tonight? 
For a list of participating 
restaurants and details

reward, visit
