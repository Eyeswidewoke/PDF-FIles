For the Period 2/1/12 to 2/29/12 
For your convenience we have combined statement(s) for activity you conduct 
through J.P. Morgan in one package. Below are important disclosures relating 
to these different accounts. 
These statements may relate to various account types. Some of the 
disclosures are applicable to all of your accounts. For ease of reference 
the disclosures applicable to a particular type 
of account have been grouped together by descriptive headers. 
IMPORTANT GENERAL INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO ALL OF YOUR ACCOUNT(S) 
Important Information about Pricing ,Valuations, Estimated Annual Income, 
and Estimated Yield 
Market value information (including without limitation, prices, exchange 
rates, accrued income and bond ratings) furnished herein, some of which has 
been provided by pricing sources that J.P. Morgan 
believes to be reliable, is not guaranteed for accuracy but provided for 
informational purposes and is furnished for the exclusive use of the client. 
The current price is the value of the financial asset share, unit or 
contract as priced at the close of the market on the last day of the 
statement period or the last available price. All values provided for 
structured yield deposits (for example, JPMorgan London Time Deposits) 
reflect the original deposit amount only. The value for Real Estate, Mineral 
Interests and Miscellaneous Assets may not reflect 
the most current value of the asset. 
Certain assets including but not limited to, pooled and private investments, 
non-publicly traded and infrequently traded securities, derivatives, 
partnership interests and tangible assets are generally 
illiquid, the value of such asset may have been provided to us by third 
parties who may or may not be independent of the issuer or manager. Such 
information is reflected as of the last date provided to 
us, and is not independently verified. 
Important information regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt 
or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically 
in an auction. Although there may be daily, weekly 
and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If 
there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available 
for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the event 
of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will 
develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected 
on statements and online. Accordingly, investors should not 
rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with 
respect to ARS. Where J.P. Morgan was unable to obtain a price from an 
outside service for a particular ARS, the price column on 
your statement and online will indicate "$0.00" which should not be relied 
on as the price at which ARS would trade. 
J.P. Morgan makes no representation, warranty or guarantee, express or 
implied, that any quoted value represents the actual terms at which 
transactions or securities could be bought or sold or new 
transactions could be entered into, or the actual terms on which existing 
transactions or securities could be liquidated. Such values may only be 
indicative.
