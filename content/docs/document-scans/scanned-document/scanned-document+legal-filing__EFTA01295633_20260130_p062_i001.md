785 F.3d 895, "; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, **;

instance, then black bidding rates artificially rise and black selection rates artificially fall. 
These effects might explain, for instance, why the black bidder selection rate for January 
2001 to December 2003 -- when actual data was available -- was three times higher than 
the calculated selection rate for December 1999 to January 2001 — when projected data 
was used. If, during the projected period, the hypothesized number of black bidders in the 
pool (artificially) rose while the number of black bidder selections stayed the same, then 
the hypothesized black selection rate would be (artificially) driven down during the 
projected period. ["108] 
c. 
The majority nevertheless dubs the extrapolated data "sound." Maj. op. at 17. That 
conclusion, however, reflects an unwillingness to confront genuine concerns over 
statistical validity. 
For instance, although admitting that the change-of-status forms are ambiguous, the 
majority blames Nucor for not explaining how these ambiguities would affect Plaintiffs' 
statistical accuracy. Maj. op. at 22. That burden was not Nucor's. Cf. Cooper v. Smith & 
Nephew, Inc., 259 F.3d 194, 199 (4th Cir. 2001) (noting that the "proponent of the 
testimony" bears the burden of proving that it is reliable). Recently, for example, the Court 
affirmed a district court's refusal to consider statistical evidence offered to show disparate 
impact because the evidence contained a number of "mistakes and omissions" in its 
analysis. EEOC v. Freeman, 778 F.3d 463, 467 (4th Cir. 2015) . The Court did so even 
though the plaintiff there raised the very same argument that the majority now embraces: 
that the employer never "shoveled] that correcting the errors would negate the disparate 
impact." Brief for Appellant at 26, Freeman, 778 F.3d 463, 2014 WL 320746. The Court 
appropriately rejected that argument then; it should have done the same now. 
['939] Rather than focusing on the reliability of the extrapolated statistics, the majority 
prefers to revisit the Brown I dissent. ["109] See maj. op. at 20-21. That dissent noted 
some of the concerns mentioned here: not all change-of-status forms used to extrapolate 
openings reflect promotions, many forms are unclear, and few forms indicate whether 
positions were posted. See Brown I, 576 F.3d at 168 (Agee, J., concurring in part and 
dissenting in part) . To illustrate these concerns, the dissent examined "the change-of-
status forms found in the record for 2000." Id. Bear in mind that, at least up to that point, 
Plaintiffs had never produced the particular change-of-status forms that they relied upon to 
guesstimate their statistics. Nor had they informed the Court that the forms in the record 
were not those upon which they based their statistical evidence. So, the Brown I dissent 
used the only change-of-status forms that were available to assess whether they could 
credibly support Plaintiffs' alleged statistical disparities. Id. Although the majority labels this 
exercise "sua sponte fact-finding," maj. op. at 21, the discussion in the Brown I dissent 
consisted of nothing more than explication by example. 
The majority then attempts to tie the district court's decertification decision to the "error" 
that the majority mistakenly identifies in the ["`110] Brown I dissent. According to the 
majority, the district court committed "clear factual error' by assuming that the change-of-
status forms discussed in the Brown I dissent were those that Plaintiffs relied upon to build 
their statistical model. But here's the rub: the district court expressly disclaimed that very
