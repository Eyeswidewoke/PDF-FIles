Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Competition 
The food and drug retail industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors that affect our business are location, 
quality, price, service, selection and condition of assets such as our stores. 
We face intense competition from other food and/or drug retailers, supercenters, club stores, online providers, specialty and niche 
supermarkets, drug stores, general merchandisers, wholesale stores, discount stores, convenience stores and restaurants. We and our 
competitors engage in price and non-price competition which, from time to time, has adversely affected our operating margins. 
For more information on the competitive pressures that we face, see Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—
Competition in our industry is intense, and our failure to compete successfully may adversely affect our profitability and results of 
operations? 
Raw Materials 
Various agricultural commodities constitute the principal raw materials used by the company in the manufacture of its food 
products. We believe that raw materials for our products are not in short supply, and all are readily available from a wide variety of 
independent suppliers. 
Environmental Laws 
Our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws, including those relating to waste management, air emissions 
and underground storage tanks. In addition, as an owner and operator of commercial real estate, we may be subject to liability under 
applicable environmental laws for clean-up of contamination at our facilities. Compliance with, and clean-up liability under, these laws 
has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, liquidity or operating results. 
See "—Legal Proceedings" and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Unfavorable changes in, failure to comply 
with or increased costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations could adversely affect us. The storage and sale of petroleum 
products could cause disruptions and expose us to potentially significant liabilities? 
Employees 
As of February 28. 2015 and excluding the effect of divestitures, we employed approximately 265,000 full- and part-time 
employees, of which approximately 174,000 were covered by collective bargaining agreements. During fiscal 2014, collective bargaining 
agreements covering approximately 50,000 employees were renegotiated. During fiscal 2015, 233 collective bargaining agreements 
covering approximately 73,000 employees are scheduled to expire. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
Legal Proceedings 
We are subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including lawsuits 
involving trade practices, lawsuits alleging violations of state and/or federal wage and hour laws (including alleged violations of meal and 
rest period laws and alleged misclassification issues), real estate disputes and other matters. Some of these suits purport or may be 
determined to be class actions and/or seek substantial damages. 
It is our management's opinion that although the amount of liability with respect to certain of the matters described herein cannot 
be ascertained at this time, any resulting liability of these and other matters, including any punitive damages, will not have a material 
adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
