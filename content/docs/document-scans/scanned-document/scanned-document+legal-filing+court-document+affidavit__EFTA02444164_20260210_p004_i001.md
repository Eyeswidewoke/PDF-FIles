rights to holders of shares of Common Stock). Additionally, it is anticipated that the Company, 
pursuant to a stock option or other incentive plan or otherwise, may issue or grant stock and/or 
stock options to directors, officers, employees and others. The Company has already set aside 
2,800,000 shares of its Common Stock to be issued pursuant to such a plan and may set aside 
additional shares in the future. The issuance of options or shares of Common Stock pursuant to 
any such plan would likely have a dilutive effect upon any investor's equity holdings in the 
Company. 
The securities being offered by the Company are likely to be an illiquid investment, as least 
for the foreseeable future. 
Neither the offer nor sale of any of the Units, the Constituent Securities and the 
Underlying Shares has been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any 
jurisdiction in reliance on exemptions from registration. The Units, the Constituent Securities and 
the Underlying Shares may not be resold unless the resale is subsequently registered under the 
Securities Act and the applicable state securities laws or, in the opinion of counsel to the 
Company, an exemption from registration is available. Moreover, there is no market for the any 
of the Units, the Constituent Securities and the Underlying Shares or any of the Company's other 
securities, and there is no assurance that any such market will develop in the future. As a result, 
an investor must be prepared to continue to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Units 
and Constituent Securities (and, to the extent acquired, any Underlying Shares) for an indefinite 
period of time. If a market for any of such securities does not develop, it will be very difficult, if 
not impossible, for an investor to resell any such securities. 
The offering price for the Units (as well as the terms of the Offering, including the 
characteristics, terms and conditions of the Constituent Securities) has been determined 
solely and arbitrarily by the Company. 
The offering price for the Units bears no relationship to the Company's book value, results 
of operations, net asset value or projected earnings or any other objective criteria of value. The 
offering price should not be regarded as an indication of the value of the Company or the value of 
the Units or Constituent Securities or of the value of any Underlying Shares that may be acquired 
upon the conversion or exercise of the Constituent Securities. 
The Company is, and is likely to remain, subject to control by its founder, Steven A. Victor, 
M.D. 
Prior to the Offering, Steven A. Victor, M.D., has owned or controlled all of the 
Company's outstanding capital stock and, accordingly, has controlled the election of all members 
to the Company's Board of Directors. U n consummation of the Offering, Dr. Victor (directly 
or through affiliates) will own 
shares of the Company's outstanding Common 
Stock. Even assuming the Offering is fully subscribed and investors were to acquire all of the 
Underlying Shares issuable to them upon the conversion of the Debentures and the exercise of the 
Warrants issued in the Offering, investors in the Offering would own only 
shares of 
the Company's outstanding Common Stock. Accordingly, it should be anticipated that, at least 
for the foreseeable future, Dr. Victor (directly or through affiliates) will continue to control the 
election of all members to the Company's Board of Directors and thus control the business and
