On May 9, the state council of China issued the "Guiding Principles for the 
Healthy Development of Capital Markets", which layouts the detailed roadmaps 
of china's future capital market development in nine major areas, including 
overall requirements, stock market, bond market, private equity, futures 
market, the competitiveness of the securities and futures sector, capital 
market openness, financial risks and market regulation. The policy is also 
referred as the "New National Nine Rules", in contrast to the earlier 
"National Nine Rules" issued in 2004. under the nine broad guidelines, 
details on the directions and goals of reforms for thirty-three areas are 
specified, signaling the unprecedented resolution of Chinese government to 
push forward the comprehensive capital market reforms. It is government's aim 
to establish multi-layer capital markets, enlarge corporate and household 
investment channel, encourage efficient capital allocation as well as promote 
the economic restructuring. From macroeconomic perspective, we highlight the 
below reforms: 
Further opening up china's capital markets 
Following the recent announcement of shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect scheme 
on Apr 10, the Guideline again emphasizes on opening up the capital markets, 
with an aim to facilitate the cross-border investment and financing 
activities. Both inward and outward investment quotas under QFII and QDII 
programs will be increased. The shareholding limits for foreign capital in 
listcos will be relaxed. Domestic capital market will be steadily opened up 
for the direct investment of foreign individuals, and the domestic 
individuals investing in foreign capital market will be orderly pushed 
forward. Moreover, Xiao Gang, chairman of CSRC said this March that the 
potential QFII expansion is huge, and he mentioned that CSRC has been working 
on the QFII tax policy with other government agencies, as part of the effort 
to help facilitate QFII expansion this year. 
we believed that this proposal will help inject more liquidity into China A 
share market, as well as expedite china's progresses in capital account 
liberalization in a boarder sense, including a) further relaxing the foreign 
investment management like holding period and remittance; b) implementing and 
expanding the stock connect scheme (see our Apr 11 note "A leap in china's 
efforts to liberalize capital accounts"); c) establishing capital account 
convertibility in SHFTZ and developing a domestic RMB offshore market; d) 
permitting cross-border RMB remittances by individuals and broadening 
channels for offshore banks to borrow/lend RMB in domestic market. 
Promoting direct-financing 
To develop a multi-layer capital market with proper structure, complete 
function and effective regulation by 2020, the Guideline highlighted the 
development of direct financing, which includes three major areas of bond 
market, equity market and private equity. 
On bond market, the Guideline aimed to a) develop a scheme of local 
government bond issuance; 2) enrich bond products suitable for various 
investors; 3) develop bond types for SMEs; 4) connect different bond 
exchanges and 5) improve issuance procedure, rating mechanism as well 
as 6) promote asset securitization. To develop a multi-layered equity 
market and cultivate a healthy private equity market are other two 
major areas in promoting the direct-financing. 
In A share stock market, the approval-based stock issuance system will 
be replaced by a registration-based one, and such move will be 
accompanied by the new IPOS governing rules published by the Securities 
Association of China the same day of the Guideline. Regulators will 
crackdown insider trading, enhance information disclosure, improve 
delisting regime, and support pension funds investments into capital 
markets by preferential tax policies. 
The State council also said it will foster the market for private 
equity funds and venture capital funds. Going forward, the placement of
