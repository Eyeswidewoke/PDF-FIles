ERISA CONSIDERATIONS 
The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. as amended ("MUSA"), imposes certain requirements on 
"employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title I of ERISA, including entities such 
as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans 
(collectively. -ERISA Plans") and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments 
by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment 
prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan's investments be made in accordance with the 
documents governing the Plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible 
fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan's particular circumstances and all of the facts 
and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to. the matters discussed above under "Risk Factors" 
and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to sell or otherwise 
dispose of any Securities it may purchase. 
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA 
Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but to which Section 4975 of the Code applies, such as 
individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, including entities whose underlying assets include the assets of 
such plans (collectively, together with ERISA Plans, "Plans")) and certain persons (referred to as "parties in 
interest" or "disqualified persons") having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative 
exemption is applicable to the transaction (each a "prohibited transaction"). A party in interest or disqualified 
person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities 
under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Plan that is engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited 
transaction may be subject to penalties under ERISA and the Code. 
The Co-Issuers, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Fiscal Agent and the Investment 
Manager and any of their respective Affiliates may be parties in interest and disqualified persons with respect to 
many Plans. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may 
arise if Securities am acquired or held by a Plan with respect to which the Co-Issuers, the Initial Purchaser, the 
Trustee, the Fiscal Agent or the Investment Manager, or am' of their respective Affiliates, is a party in interest or a 
disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and 
Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, in certain cases, depending in part on the type of Plan 
fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Securities and the circumstances under which such decision is made. 
Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(dX20) of the Code (relating to 
transactions with certain service providers) and Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption ("PTCE") 91-38 (relating 
to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by independent 
"qualified professional asset managers"). PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance company general 
accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 
(relating to transactions determined by certain "in-house asset managers"). There can be no assurance that any of 
these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving 
Securities. 
Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), non-U.S. plans (as defined in Section 4(b)(4) of 
ERISA) and certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary 
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to 
non-U.S., federal. state. local or other applicable laws that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of 
ERISA and the Code ("Similar Laws"). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before 
purchasing any Securities. 
EACH PURCHASER OF AN ERISA LIMITED SECURITY IN THE INITIAL OFFERING THEREOF AND 
EACH SUBSEQUENT TRANSFEREE OF A DEFINITIVE SECURITY WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPRESENT 
AND WARRANT. AND EACH PURCHASER OF A SECURITY (INCLUDING TRANSFEREES) 
REPRESENTED BY AN INTEREST IN ANY GLOBAL SECURITY WILL BE DEEMED BY SUCH PURCHASE 
OR ACQUISITION TO HAVE REPRESENTED AND WARRANTED, ON EACH DAY FROM THE DATE ON 
WHICH THE PURCHASER ACQUIRES SUCH INTEREST THROUGH AND INCLUDING THE DATE ON 
WHICH THE PURCHASER DISPOSES OF SUCH INTEREST, THAT ITS PURCHASE, HOLDING AND 
DISPOSITION OF SUCH INTEREST WILL NOT CONSTITUTE OR RESULT IN A PROHIBITED 
TRANSACTION UNDER SECTION 406 OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE (OR IN A VIOLATION
