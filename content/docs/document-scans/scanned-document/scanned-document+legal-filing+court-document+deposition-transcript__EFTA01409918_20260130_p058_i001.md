2012, by 14.3% in 2013 and by 11.4% in 2014 and depreciated further by 29.4% 
on a year-over-year basis in the thirteen weeks ended March 29, 
2015. Our reported consolidated results of operations have periodically been 
affected by the strength of the US dollar relative to the Brazilian real 
and further appreciation of the US dollar in the future periods could affect 
adversely our consolidated results of operations in those periods. 
Disruptions in financial markets may also result in significant changes in 
foreign exchange rates in relatively short periods of time which further 
increases the risk of an adverse currency effect. We do not currently use 
financial derivatives or hedging agreements to manage our currency 
exposure. In the future, we may choose to use a combination of natural 
hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against foreign 
currency exchange rate risks. However, such activities may be ineffective or 
may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect 
resulting from foreign currency variations. 
Our company's principal asset is its ownership interest in Fogo de Chao 
(Holdings) Inc. and if that subsidiary or our other subsidiaries 
are restricted from distributing or repatriating funds to us, pursuant to 
law, regulation or otherwise, our liquidity, financial condition or results 
of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
We have no material assets other than our ownership of the equity interests 
in our subsidiaries and no independent means of generating 
revenue. To the extent that we need funds, and our subsidiaries are 
restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or 
regulation, or 
is otherwise unable to provide such funds, such restrictions or inability 
could materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and 
results of operations. 
Brazilian law permits the Brazilian government to impose temporary 
restrictions on conversions of Brazilian currency into foreign currencies 
and on remittances to foreign investors of proceeds from their investments 
in Brazil, whenever there is a serious imbalance in Brazil's balance of 
payments or there are reasons to expect a pending serious imbalance. Any 
imposition of restrictions on conversions and remittances could hinder or 
prevent our Brazilian subsidiaries from converting Brazilian currency into 
US dollars or other foreign currencies and remitting abroad dividends or 
distributions. As a result, any imposition of exchange controls restrictions 
could reduce the market prices of the shares of our common stock. 
Additionally, the terms of our Senior Credit Facilities include, and the 
terms of our New Credit Facility will include, a number of restrictive 
covenants that impose restrictions on our subsidiaries' ability to, among 
other things, make certain restricted payments, including dividends to us. 
Cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may also limit our 
ability to convert foreign currencies such as the real into US dollars or 
to remit payments by our Brazilian subsidiaries or businesses located in or 
conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. We may 
face similar risks in other international jurisdictions in which we operate. 
While we have repatriated cash historically, in the future we do not intend 
to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant
