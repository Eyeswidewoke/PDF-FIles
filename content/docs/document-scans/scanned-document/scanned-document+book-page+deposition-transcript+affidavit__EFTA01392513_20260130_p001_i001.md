Underlying Fund; (vi) the Interests will be subject to certain restrictions on transferability as described in 
the Partnership Agreement, and no transfer or assignment of any Interests or any part of any Interest may 
occur if such transfer or assignment would cause any beneficial interest in the Partnership to be held by a

or an "accredited investor" under the Securities Act (vii) the Investor will have no right to withdraw from 
the Partnership except as specifically provided in the Agreement; (viii) as a result of the foregoing, the
