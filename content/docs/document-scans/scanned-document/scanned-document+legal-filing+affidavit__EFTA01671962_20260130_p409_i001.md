Arbitration 
You or we may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator. 
If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor we will have the right to litigate that claim in 
court or have a jury trial on that claim. Further, you and we will not have the right to participate in a 
representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. 
Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more 
limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very 
limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and 
binding. Other rights you or we would have in court may also not be available in arbitration. 
Initiating Arbitration 
Before beginning arbitration, you or we must first send a claim notice. Claims will be referred to either 
JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this 
Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where 
those rules conflict with this Agreement. If we choose the organization, you may select the other within 30 
days after receiving notice of our selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other 
information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and we agree in writing 
or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Ad, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1.16 (FAA). 
We will not elect arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual 
and pending only in that court. You or we may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it 
has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered. Either you or we may 
delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, including the right to arbitrate a 
claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights. 
Limitations on Arbitration 
If either party elects to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual 
basis. There will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or 
on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general 
public, other cardmembers or other persons similarly situated. 
The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or 
consolidated unless you and we agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will 
apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. 
Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of 
these Limitations on Arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision 
(other than this sentence) will not apply. 
Arbitration Procedures 
This Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, 
statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil 
procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on 
Arbitration, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be 
confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim. 
If your claim is for $10.000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the 
basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing. At any party's request, the 
arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrators award will be final and 
binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to 
appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will 
appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any 
aspect of the decision objected to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having 
jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your 
residence.
