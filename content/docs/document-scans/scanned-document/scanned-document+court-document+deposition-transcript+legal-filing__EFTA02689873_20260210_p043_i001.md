evaluation. The General Partner may only be removed by means of a resolution of the General Meeting adopted 
further to fraud, gross negligence. wilful misconduct or for insolvency provided that the fraud, gross negligence, 
wilful misconduct or insolvency has been established by a final court decision. The success of the Company 
depends significantly on the efforts and abilities of its General Partner to evaluate investment opportunities and 
to select the right agents including the Investment Adviser. Although the General Partner will devote such time 
and effort as may be reasonably required to implement the objectives of the Company, there can be no guarantee 
that its undertaking will be successful. 
25.13 
Limited Shareholders will not participate in the management of the Company. Subscribers of the Ordinary 
Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Memorandum will become Limited Shareholders and will 
have no impact on the management and the decision process which remains under the control of the General 
Partner. 
Key persons 
25.14 
The success of the Company (and any of its Compartment) will largely depend on the experience, relationships 
and expertise of the key persons — in particular, the Managers, the directors, employees and agents of the 
Investment Adviser and the members of any Investment Committee — which have experience in the respective 
area of investment. The performance of the Company (and any of its Compartment) may be negatively affected if 
any of the key persons would for any reason cease to be involved. 
25.15 
Key persons might also be involved in other businesses, including a similar investments as the one undertaken 
for the account of a relevant Compartment, and not be able to devote all of their time to the Company (or the 
relevant Compartment). Such involvement may additionally be source for potential conflicts of interest. 
Restrictions on Transfer and redemption 
25.16 
Shares arc subject to restrictions on Transfer. Investors may in principle not withdraw capital from the Company 
other than to the extent of current income and disposal proceeds when and as required to be distributed by the 
Company. 
Distributions 
25.17 
There can be no assurance that the operations of the Company (or a Compartment thereof) will be profitable, 
that the Company (or a Compartment thereof) will be able to avoid losses or that cash from its operations will be 
available for distribution to the Investors. The Company (or a Compartment thereof) will have no other source of 
funds from which to pay distributions to the Investors than income and gains received from Investments. In 
addition, Investors should be aware that any amount distributed to them may have to be returned to the Company 
(or the relevant Compartment) in accordance with Sections 18.8 to 18.10 of the General Section (and as may be 
further provided in respect of a specific Compartment in the relevant Special Section). 
Performance allocation and fees 
25.18 
Certain Compartment may provide that the General Partner, any Manager, the Investment Adviser Company or 
any other party may be entitled to receive incentive compensation including carried interest, performance fee or 
similar remuneration schemes. The fact that these incentive compensations are based on the performance of the 
relevant Compartment may create an incentive for the beneficiary to cause the Compartment to make Investments 
that are riskier than would be the case in the absence of performance-based compensation. 
Lack of operating history 
25.19 
The Company will be a newly formed entity, with no significant operating history upon which to evaluate the 
Company's likely performance.
