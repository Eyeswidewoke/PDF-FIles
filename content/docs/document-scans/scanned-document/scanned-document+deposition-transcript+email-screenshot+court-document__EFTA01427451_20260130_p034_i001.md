We believe we have a highly engaged consumer base of passionate pet parents, 
who connect with our authentic story of a pet food 
brand that is "by pet parents for pet parents." Our goal is for the buffalo 
icon and the BLUE shield featured on our products to symbolize 
quality and project a certain attitude that pet parents feel good 
associating with. We actively support pet cancer awareness and research, 
promote animal welfare and engage our pet parents in these important causes 
with special events such as the Pet Cancer Awareness Month 
during May of every year. We believe our consumers are strong advocates of 
our brand and are major contributors to our success in the 
marketplace. 
Our master brand strategy, combined with significant cumulative investments 
in highly effective marketing and brand-building of 
over $400 million since 2003, has resulted in what we believe to be one of 
the strongest brand equities in the pet food industry. We have a fullservice 
in-house advertising and marketing agency which enables us to maintain the 
authenticity of our communications, whether through 
marketing or packaging, and allows us to build a cohesive brand. This 
integrated approach gives us a significant advantage in speed-to-market 
from product development to advertising, increases our marketing 
effectiveness and creates marketing efficiencies. 
We are currently the #1 advertiser in the Wholesome Natural market segment 
by a wide margin and one of the top advertised brands 
in the industry overall. However, we still have a significant opportunity to 
expand our brand awareness compared to brands with much longer 
histories in the marketplace. We plan to continue to invest in advertising 
to increase our brand awareness and drive traffic to brick-and-mortar 
stores and eCommerce retailers where BLUE is sold. 
Our commitment to pet nutrition education is reflected in our approach to 
marketing, which has a strong call-to-action for pet parents 
to examine the ingredients in their pet food. We achieve this through our 
integrated marketing strategy and Pet Detective program. We believe 
our Pet Detective program enhances the in-store shopping experiences of our 
retail partners and provides us with the benefits of direct-toconsumer 
marketing without creating a conflict with our retail partners. We believe 
our Pet Detective program is the largest of its kind run by 
any CPG company in the United States. More recently, as we focus on 
increasing our distribution in channels outside national pet superstores, 
we have been investing in sales and marketing capabilities and programs 
suited for these different channels such as in-store merchandising to 
differentiate our products in smaller footprint neighborhood stores and web 
marketing tools to increase our conversion of online traffic. We 
also continue to look for ways to strengthen our relationships with key 
influencers in the industry (e.g., veterinarians, store associates and 
trainers) to help generate more recommendations for BLUE. 
Product Development Engine with the Broadest Portfolio 
We have the broadest portfolio of products of any natural pet food brand in 
the United States. Our tailored product offerings enable 
our pet parents to satisfy their pet's specific dietary, lifestyle and life-
