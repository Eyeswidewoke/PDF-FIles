Partner may, in its sole discretion, choose not to commit up to 10% of the Limited Partners' subscriptions 
to the Partnership for investment into the Underlying Fund. However, the General Partner is not required 
to set aside any such amounts, and may commit up to 100% of the Limited Partners' subscriptions to the 
Underlying Fund. If the General Partner over-commits the Partnership (i.e., commits an amount to the 
Underlying Fund, which together with any expenses of the Partnership. is greater than the total amount of 
the Limited Partners' subscriptions to the Partnership), the General Partner may need to fund Partnership 
expenses or future capital calls by the Underlying Fund through the distributions received from the 
Underlying Fund (in such case the Limited Partners will be allocated income without corresponding cash 
to pay taxes on such income) or through borrowings.
