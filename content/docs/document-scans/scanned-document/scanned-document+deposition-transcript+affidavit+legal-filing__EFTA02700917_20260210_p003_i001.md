sale of Vatican coins, postage stamps, and museum admissions— all of which dwindled during the 
world depressions of the 1930s— the only income the Vatican could count on was the 
approximately $2.5 million a year in interest from its government bonds, a sum that shrank with 
the declining value of the Italian currency. As the situation grew more desperate, the Pope 
assigned the remainder of what the Vatican received in compensation to an investment unit 
called "Special Administration," designed to use the Vatican's unique sovereign standing to trade 
in the foreign exchange markets. He retained Bernardino Nogara, a Jewish banker who was an 
expert in international finance, to run it. To protect the Vatican against further devaluations in 
the lira, Nogara bought gold, dollars and other foreign currency, and then borrowing against 
them. He also engaged in complex arbitrage operations that increased the Vatican's patrimony 
by more than 50 percent in ten years, while also providing the income necessary to pay the 
Vatican's deficit. So the Vatican finally found a means of economic salvation: taking advantage 
of its sovereign exemption from regulation to trade. 
The Second World War again put the Vatican in serious jeopardy. Surrounded by Fascist 
Italy, and threatened with annihilation by the Communists who were battling to take over Italy, 
Pope Pius XII briefly considered moving the Vatican to America. In 1942, as an immediate 
expedient for safeguarding its funds during the war, the Pope authorized the creation of a private 
bank within the walls of the Vatican, whose true function was obscured by its name "The 
Institute for the Works of Religion." The Vatican official charged with superintending this bank 
was Giovanni Battista Montini, a priest from a prominent banking family in northern Italy, who 
had served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State for 20 years. Montini organized the bank not 
only as a safe haven for the Vatican's own money but also as a channel through which Catholic 
dioceses, missions, orders, and other entities could invest their funds. Even after Montini left the 
Secretariat to become Archbishop of Milan in 1954, he continued overseeing the operations of 
the bank as part of a three-man commission. When he became Pope in 1963, taking the name 
Paul VI, he made the bank a key instrument of expanding Vatican financial power. 
The immediate problem confronting Pope Paul was a new Italian law requiring foreign 
investors, including the Vatican, to pay a 30 percent tax on dividends. Since this tax, if paid, 
would further squeeze Vatican income to the point that it would have to curtail services it 
considered essential, it refused to pay the tax on the grounds that it violated the Lateran Treaty of 
1929. While the stalemate continued, Pope Paul found a remedy that would not only avoid the 
issue of direct Italian taxation but which would also eliminate much of the pejorative publicity 
about its investments in Italy. The Vatican bank would transfer most of its investments to 
anonymous companies in Liechtenstein, Panama, and other secretive offshore centers. These 
companies would be removed by many layers of banks and other intermediaries from the 
Vatican. This move would also be invisible to Italian tax collectors since no worldly authority, 
not even the Italian government, had the right to inspect Vatican records. To effect this change, 
the Vatican required the help of banks that could, with utter secrecy, set up these anonymous 
accounts for it and assist in transferring its assets to them. 
The bank in Milan that Pope Paul initially turned to for help was the small and extremely private, 
as its name implied, Banca Private Finanziata. It was run by a highly-successful financier named 
Michele Sindona, who was expert at maneuvering funds offshore. 
The liaison with Sindona eventually grew dangerous. His banking empire became entangled in 
criminal investigations and some of the banks he controlled went bankrupt. As concerns 
mounted in 1969, Sindona was summoned to the Apostolic Place in the Vatican for a meeting
