Trade Ideas 
Sprint — BUY: Although bondholders didn't get the outcome they wanted as it 
relates to the highly publicized merger discussions between Sprint and T-
Mobile, we believe Sprint's standalone operational plan coupled with its vast 
optionality around liquidity make Sprint bonds attractive. We acknowledge the 
turnaround in FCF generation will take longer than originally expected, but 
that's only because the company has opted to accelerate its CapEx plans 
forward into FY18 and FY19, which we believe will result in better subscriber 
trends and financial metrics just in time for the arrival of next generation 5G 
roll-outs. 
The reinvigorated stance towards network investment comes at a time when 
Sprint will also return to services growth (FY2H18) for the first time since 
CY4Q13. As the network improves, we model in lower churn and better gross 
adds as well as improving ARPU in FY19. which will all lead to improved 
revenue trajectory as well as profitability. Sprint has considered itself the "price 
leader" in the industry for a while, but raised prices last quarter and plan to 
again, which should enhance top-line and margins. Once CapEx normalizes 
back to $4-5 billion (post-FY19), we expect Sprint to start generating billions of 
cash. 
Until then, Sprint can use its ample pockets of liquidity to deal with near-term 
obligations as well as funding CapEx. The company ended the most recent 
quarter with over $6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, has -$10.5 billion of 
Spectrum LeaseCo capacity available to them ($3.5 billion under the existing 
program and another -$7 billion under a second program), will take advantage 
of the ABS market to handle device financing, and could open up a layer of 
financing if management decides to take out the Junior Guaranteed notes. 
Currently, the indenture governing the Junior Guaranteed trenches restrict how 
much pari debt Sprint can raise ($6 billion notional), but removing that 
restrictive covenant could provide a source of liquidity at more attractive 
financing than existing unsecured bonds. Knowing there is positive liquidity 
optionality around removing that sliver of capital from the balance sheet, we 
think management may target the 7% Jr Guaranteed Notes due 2020 later in 
2018 when the 9% Jr Guaranteed Notes mature, which provides an opportunity 
to capture some alpha in a senior part of the capital structure. 
Sprint 7% Jr. G'teed Notes due 2020: 
$107.00, 3.63%, 163 bps 
Sprint 6.875% Sr Notes due 2028: 
$101.00, 6.74%, 426 bps 
Frontier Swap: 
The trajectory for Frontier has changed materially throughout 2017. Entering 
the year, many investors were still believers in an annual run-rate EBITDA of $4 
billion. The synergies were going to come through, CTF properties were going 
to inflect their subscriber figures, and DSL in the rural properties could fight off 
the less quality competition in those geographies. Almost nothing has played 
out as expected and Frontier has, again, struggled to make sense of an 
acquisition that was supposed to act as a catalyzing event that stabilized the 
business. 
While we are confident that a near-term cost reduction story is credible 
(revenue is declining so costs should be able to come down and duplicative 
spending utilized in stabilizing CTF can run off), we do not think that cost cuts 
can out-run revenue declines over even the intermediate term. Until the story 
can credibly shift to a position of discussing revenue stability, then growth, the 
Frontier story will be very challenged. We are going back to the same well in 
our trade idea in 2018, recommending the compression trade between higher 
dollar bonds and lower dollar bonds as we expect further signs of stress in the 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
