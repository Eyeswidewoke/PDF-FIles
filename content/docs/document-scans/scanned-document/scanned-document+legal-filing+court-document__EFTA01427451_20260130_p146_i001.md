Stock-based Compensation 
We recognize stock-based compensation expense for our share-based payments 
based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date. 
The fair value of our stock option grants is determined using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model. We will continue to use the Black-Scholes 
model for option pricing. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the stock-based award. 
We use a third party valuation specialist to assist us in the estimation of 
the fair value of our common stock. We believe these valuations 
to be appropriate; however, the valuation of the equity of any private 
company involves various estimates and assumptions that may differ from 
actual values. If available, we base our common stock value on actual 
transactions or other transactions that are representative of stock value. 
The 
expected volatility assumption is based on the combination of the industry 
index for pet food wholesalers and the volatility of our largest customer. 
The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on 
the U.S. Treasury implied yield at the date of grant. The weighted-average 
expected term is determined with reference to historical exercise and post-
vesting cancellation experience and the vesting period and contractual 
term of the awards. The forfeitures rate is estimated based on historical 
experience and expected future activity. We have no current plans to pay 
dividends. 
Estimating the fair value of our common stock is highly complex and 
subjective because our shares are not publicly traded. We will not 
need estimates of the fair value of our common stock to determine the fair 
value of new awards once our underlying shares begin trading publicly. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
We qualify as an emerging growth company pursuant to the provisions of the 
JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an 
"emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition 
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for 
complying with new or revised accounting standards. We intend to "opt out" 
of the extended transition period with respect to new or revised 
accounting standards and, as a result, we will comply with any such new or 
revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of 
such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the 
normal course of our business. Such risk is principally associated 
with interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. We currently do not 
enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or 
speculative purposes. 
Interest rate risk 
We are exposed to changes in interest rates because the indebtedness 
incurred under our senior secured credit facilities is variable rate 
debt. Interest rate changes generally do not affect the market value of our 
senior secured credit facilities but do affect the amount of our interest 
payments and, therefore, our future earnings and cash flows. As of December
