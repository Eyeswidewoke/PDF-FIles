Buyer's Assurance • Extend Your Warranty Up to One Year 
It's Murphy's Law--just as soon as the warranty expires, the toaster, 
wireless phone, or coffeemaker falls apart. But when you're shopping 
this fall, remember, if it's an eligible item, charged entirely to your 
Card, you're protected. The Buyer's Assurance Plan extends the 
terms of the original manufacturer's warranty on covered items up to 
one additional year on warranties of five years or less that are eligible 
in the U.S. 
Underwritten by AMEX Assurance Company, Administrative Office, Green Bay WI. 
Coverage is subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of Policy AX0953. See 
Description of Coverage for complete details.
