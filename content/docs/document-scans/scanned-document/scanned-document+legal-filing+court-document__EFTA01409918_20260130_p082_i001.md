Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
location, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to its 
carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash 
flows, an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying 
value and the fair value is recorded. The projections of future cash flows 
used in these analyses require the use of judgment and a number of estimates 
and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from 
our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in 
the future. If future impairment charges are significant, our reported 
operating results would be adversely affected. 
Changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our results 
of operations. 
Changes to existing accounting rules or regulations may impact our future 
results of operations or cause the perception that we are more 
highly leveraged. Other new accounting rules or regulations and varying 
interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred 
and may occur in the future. For example, accounting regulatory authorities 
have indicated that they may begin to require lessees to capitalize 
operating leases in their financial statements in the next few years. If 
adopted, such change would require us to record significant capital lease 
obligations on our balance sheet and make other changes to our financial 
statements. This and other future changes to accounting rules or 
regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 
Loss of key management personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our 
ability to operate and grow successfully. 
Our success will continue to depend, to a significant extent, on our 
leadership team and other key management personnel. If we are unable to 
attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable management 
personnel, our business and financial results may suffer. If members of our 
leadership team or other key management personnel leave, we may have 
difficulty replacing them, and our business may suffer. There can be no 
assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain our 
leadership team and other key management personnel that we need. We also do 
not maintain any key man life insurance policies for any of our employees. 
Our current insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage 
against all claims, and we may incur losses that are not 
covered by our insurance. 
We maintain insurance coverage for a significant portion of our risks and 
associated liabilities with respect to general liability, property and 
casualty liability, liquor liability, employer's liability and other 
insurable risks. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot 
be 
insured against or that we believe are not commercially reasonable to 
insure. For example, insurance covering liability for violations of wage and 
hour laws has not generally been available. We also self-insure for workers' 
compensation and health benefits under plans with high deductibles. 
Losses for such uninsured claims, if they occur, could have a material 
adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
Compliance with environmental laws may negatively affect our business.
