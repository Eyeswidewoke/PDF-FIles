prediction). However, I now have someone here in Hong Kong (funded directly by 
me, outside the ITF project) working for a few months on modifying Itamar's 
computer vision system (DeSTIN) to make it more compatible with OpenCog, so we 
can use it in 2013-2014 as OpenCog's visual and auditory cortex. 
Remember in 2001 you funded me to write a book on my design for AGI, and I didn't 
finish it? A first draft of that book is finally done ("Building Better Minds: The 
CogPrime Architecture for Artificial General Intelligence"); it's about 1000 pages 
long and you can see it online at 
http://gocrtzcl.org/monkeyburger/bbm main.pdf 
It is complete regarding content, but still needs editing for style, fixing references, 
aligning figures, etc. At the moment a few colleagues are going over it carefully and 
making a long list of things needing fixing. My plan is to send you a copy of the 
proofs once it's finally truly ready for the publisher. As your time is scarce, I don't 
want to waste your time having you read a messy version when there will be a clean 
version available a few months later. Just for fun, I have attached the Table of 
Contents to this email... 
We have gotten an offer of more funding from the Hong Kong government, for a 
project spanning 2013-2014, which is supposed to focus on using OpenCog to 
control one of David Hanson's Robokind humanoid robots: 
http://hansonrobokind.comDavid Hanson has been spending about 1/4 of his time 
here in Hong Kong, and has become a fairly close friend. I've also spent a bunch of 
time with Mark Tilden, the maker of the Robo Sapien ( 
http://en.wikipcdia.org/wiki/Mark Tilden), who is based in in Hong Kong as well. 
The Robokind's hands aren't that great but we will supply it with a bunch of foam 
blocks so it can do blocks-world type stuff, similar to in the video game world. Its 
camera eyes are high-quality, so the main aspect we'll need to deal with for the 
Robokind project, that we aren't needing to deal with for the current game-Al 
project, is machine vision. For this we will use the DeSTIN framework, currently 
being improved my someone working for me as I noted above. 
This funding for the robotics project is of a similar nature to the game-Al funding: 
9/10 Hong Kong government 1/10 me. So I was going to email you in a few weeks 
to ask you if you'd be willing to help me with my 1/10 of the money like you did 
before. That would be very greatly appreciated, obviously. What is needed is 
US$2OK in December, and another US$2OK in late 2013. 
By the way, the AGI-12 conference is at Oxford University December 8-11. This 
looks like it will be smaller than the previous AGI conferences, due to the location 
being in the UK and in the winter. But it should be a very interesting group of 
people -- including my robotics collaborator David Hanson, who would be a really 
interesting guy for you to meet If you have time, it would be awesome if you could 
attend:
