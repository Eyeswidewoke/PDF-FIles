 n Valentine's Day, Sharry Billings posted a 
photograph on Instagram. Below the image of 
herself, her hair a red-caramel and her smile 
open, she wrote: "I love you so much I wanna 
squeeze you!"
The object of her affection? "All the motorcycles I have 
owned and will own in the future," she explained. Alongside 
the photo of her astride a Harley-Davidson, she wrote that 
bikes "have changed my life, healed my soul, and brought me 
more love and friendships than I could have ever imagined r 
Billings goes.by @sistermotherl3 on Instagram, but the 
main account she oversees is @thelitaslosangeles. The Litas 
is a group she joined three years ago as a way to connect with 
other women riders in her city. She's co-led the L.A. branch 
for two years. When she joined, it provided her with much-
needed healing and Camaraderie after her kids grew up and 
she got divorced. Billings had ridden as a teenager and into 
her 20s but took a hiatus later. "It was always in my heart," 
she says. But when she was married with young children, "I 
thought it was a little too dangerous?' 
' After the breakup in 2015, she found herself longing for 
escape. And adventure. "My prayer at the time was, 'God, I 
don't want to date: These men are not happening," Billings 
says, laughing. "The first thing that came to 'my heart was the 
motorcycle I wanted. It was a Harley." 
night pizza runs, say, or weekend coffee meetups—and they 
take periodic excursions to women-only destination events 
such as the Wild Gypsy Tour, which is organizing a festival in 
Sturgis, S.D., in August, and the Dream Roll in Ashland, Ore. 
The biggest crowd follows Babes Ride Out, a series of 
events founded by Anya Violet and Ashmore Ellis in 2013. It 
started with so women riders who gathered to camp out in 
Borrego Springs, Calif. They built fires, pitched tents, drank 
beer, and played games on Harleys, Husqvamas, and Hondas 
while soaking in nature and one another's company. 
These groups are tapping into an undercurrent of the 
motorcycle industry. As sales have faltered, dropping more 
than 4o% from 2008 to 2010, then recovering somewhat by 
2014 but never to previous levels, manufacturers including 
Harley-Davidson Inc. and BMW Motorrad have struggled to 
create appeal beyond their core demographic of older white 
men. Their efforts include offering electric and less-expensive 
motorbikes and introducing exciting conceptual prototypes. 
Female riders offer enthusiasm and youth, and, yes, they're 
spending money that brands crave. 
The number of women who own motorcycles has almost 
doubled since 2010, according to a 2018 study by the Motorcycle 
Industry Council. Today, 19% of owners are women, up from 
10% in 2009 and 8% in the late 19905. And the number of female 
riders gets higher as you go younger: 22% of Generation X 
While the industry on the whole dropped 
40% from 2008 to 2010, the amount of women who 
own motorcycles has almost doubled 
She bought the bike, took the ride. Then she joined the 
Litas. "I'm very grateful to have found my heart again," 
Billings says. 
Founded in Utah byJessica Haggett half a decade ago, the 
Litas have expanded to include hundreds of branches around 
the world (Litas Denver, Litas Lisbon, Litas Rome?, with 
members ranging from twentysomething singles to 6o-and 
70-year-old retirees with EA-maids. They take regular rides, 
often along wild back roads, including the Pine Mountain 
Ridge route near Ojai, Calif., that Billings took with 32 other 
riders one Saturday in July. It's about riding with your own 
style and pace but surrounded by like-minded friends. 
"If you're learning to ride, you're going to kill yourself rid-
ing with men—they ride like bats out of hell!" Billings says. 
"And women—I'm generalizing here—tend to be more careful. 
We are mothers, we are sisters, we feel obligated to stay alive." 
The Litas are singular but not uncommon. All across 
California, Oregon, and Utah, from Texas to New York, women-
only motorcycle groups and riding events are springing up 
like wildflowers. They go by names such as the Miss-Fires 
(Brooldyn, N.Y.), the Chrome Divas (Austin), and Leather and 
Lace (Daytona Beach, Fla.). They do regular rides: Tuesday 
riders are women, and 26% of millennial riders are women. 
What's more, the average woman who owns a motorcycle 
spends $574 annually on maintenance, parts, service, and 
accessories, while the average man who rides spends $497. 
"We are riding a ton," says Joy Lewis, who started when 
she was 12. "I have a friend who put 20,000 miles on her bike 
in one year." Lewis's father, an Alaskan crab fisherman who 
owned a Harley, got her hooked. '
e spend a lot of money 
on our gear and our bikes, and a lot of things to go with them. 
I think that's starting to be appreciated?' 
Andy Jefferson, a spokesman for Husqvarna, says one of 
the brand's priorities must be to provide support for wom-
en's motorcycling. "We were like everyone else—going after a 
piece of the pie;' he says. "But everyone was looking at men, 
and there are all these other people-women-that nobody 
even really talks about in conversations about how to sell 
more bikes" The brand lacks figures for how many of its own-
ers are women but is "working to change thatflefferson says. 
"That's part of the problem:'

Husqvarna honed in on women riders five years ago when 
it started sponsoring Babes in the Dirt, an offshoot of Babes 
Ride Out that's more focused on off-road and dirt-bike riding.
