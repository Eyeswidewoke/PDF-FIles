There is an understandable reluctance to admit that some visual depictions of 
children may or may not be child pornography depending on the totality of the 
facts. Looking only at the visual depiction of the child, however, often does not 
resolve the issue. What then is the difference between simple nudity and art and 
what the law describes as lewd or lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic 
area? 
Because I am not a lawyer, I am not sure that I totally understand the 
subtleties of what the appellate courts have said about this issue. Some of it even 
appears to be contradictory. But after more than 20 years of studying this area, I 
am sure of what investigators, prosecutors, and the courts should say and what 
common sense demands. 
The court in Knox concluded by stating that "we reject any contention, whether 
implied by the government or not, that the child subject must be shown to have 
engaged in the sexually explicit conduct with a lascivious intent" (32 F.3d at 747).. 
In my opinion the government caused this "error," in part, by a cold, analytical 
examination of words on a page instead of a reasonable interpretation of them 
based on some understanding of the nature of the crime and intent of the statute 
to protect children and prosecute those who sexually exploit them. 
Hypothetical Example 
To synopsize this controversy, consider this set of hypothetical facts based on 
several actual cases. A mother or father innocently photographs their naked 
1-year-old daughter getting out of the bathtub, they send the film to the store to 
be developed, and they then put the returned print in the family album with all 
the other photographs of their child's life. Under these circumstances, in their 
family album, this photograph showing the child's genitals is dearly not child 
pornography. 
Unknown to them, however, a pedophile working at the store made an extra 
print of the photograph, took it home, and put it in one of his photo albums 
containing hundreds of other similar photographs of naked little girls he had 
previously stolen after they were turned in for developing. Printed in big letters 
on the cover of this album are the words "Hot Lolitas." In the album, below the 
photograph of this naked 1-year-old, is a handwritten caption indicating how 
sexually aroused the pedophile gets when he looks at this picture. Above this 
photograph he has added a "balloon" with words indicating that the child wants 
to have sex with him. There are also semen stains on the pages. He has modified 
some of the other photographs by cropping out the children's faces or adding 
sexual characteristics/activity with a marker or pen. 
Can the exact same picture of the naked 1-year-old girl getting out of the tub 
that was an innocent nude in her family's album now be considered child por-
nography in the possession of this pedophile? Can it be child pornography if the 
original photographer/producer did not intend to elicit a sexual response in the 
viewer? Do we evaluate the potential lascivious nature of it by looking only at the 
picture? Does the theft of the photograph, the surrounding materials in the 
albums, or the modifications to the picture play a role in this decision? Is lascivi-
ous interest on the part of the collector of no importance? If prosecutors believe 
such a photograph cannot be considered child pornography, are they prepared to 
publicly say so? It seems like a waste of time to attempt to determine if a ques-
tionable photograph is child pornography only by staring at it and applying the
