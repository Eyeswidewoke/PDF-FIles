The surprisingly large value of r, the ratio of power in tensor to scalar density perturbations 
in the CMB reported by the BICEP2 Collaboration provides strong evidence for Inflation at the 
CUT scale. In order to provide compelling evidence, other possible sources of the signal need 
to be ruled out. While the Inflationary signal remains the best motivated source, the current 
measurement unfortunately still allows for the poodbility that a comparable gravitational wave 
background might result from a self ordering scalar field transition that takes place later at somewhat 
lower energy. However even marginally improved limits on the possible isocurvature contribution 
to CRIB anistropies could rule out this possibility, and essentially all other sources of the observed 
signal other than Inflation. 
The recent claimed observation of primordial gravita-
tional waves [1] provides a dramatic new empirical win-
dow on the early universe. In particular, it provides the 
opportunity, in principle, to definitively test the inflation-
ary paradigm[2, 3], and to explore the specific physics of 
inflationary models. However, while there is little doubt 
that inflation at the Grand Unified Scale is the best mo-
tivated source of such primordial waves (e.g. [4-7], it 
is important to demonstrate that other possible sources 
cannot account for the current BICEP2 data before def-
initely claiming Inflation has been proved. 
A surprisingly large value of r, the ratio of power in 
tensor modes to scalar density perturbations provides a 
challenge for other possible primordial sources, as such 
sources would have to generate gravitational waves effi-
ciently without altering the observed adiabatic density 
fluctuations that are so consistent with inflationary pre-
dictions. Here we explore to what extent that challenge 
might rule out other possibilities. 
We have previously explored a relatively generic pos-
sible competing source of a scale invariant spectrum of 
tensor modes [8 10], a simple self ordering scalar field 
(SOSF) in the early universe, and frankly had hoped that 
the BICEP2 observation would rule out this possibility, 
thus allowing a cleaner interpretation of the the existing 
data in terms of inflation. As we describe here unfortu-
nately the measured value of r falls just short of ruling 
out this other source as the dominant contribution of the 
observed effect. Nevertheless, as we also show, reducing 
the bound on any possible isocurvature component of the 
scalar power spectrum can rule out this possibility, and 
therefore any likely candidate source after inflation that 
produces gravitational waves. This would then imply 
the BICEP2 result definitely reflects gravitational waves 
from inflation, with all of the exciting concomitant int-
plications (i.e. quantization of gravity (11]). 
In the following we assume inflation occurs, and pro-
vides the measured adiabatic scalar density fluctua-
tions inferred from CMB measurements (because that 
is strongly suggested by the data), but that a SOSF 
phase transition occurs after inflation, producing a grav-
itational wave signature that might overwhelm the infla-
tionary signal. 
Let S, and Ti denote the scalar and tensor power gen-
erated by inflation and Sc, and Tv, the same quanti-
ties for the self-ordered scalar field. Out of these four 
quantities one can form several ratios of interest: (i) 
Teff = (71 +TO1(51+4) is the tensor to scalar ratio in-
corporating both sources that has just been observed to 
have a central value of 0.2. (ii) The self-ordering scalar 
field produces isocurvature scalar fluctuations whereas 
inflation produces adiabatic ones. Measurements of the 
temperature anisotropies constrain the isocurvature frac-
tion x = Sv,/(S, + Sy) to lie in the range 0 < x < 0.09 
(12]. (iii) rn =T.1Sp, the tensor-to-scalar ratio for the 
SOSF case, can be calculated within the self-ordering 
scalar field model using the scalar power spectrum de-
scribed in (13] along with the tensor power given in [9, 10], 
and is found to be 2.34 (iv) f =TST„ the ratio of the 
tensor contributions from the SOSF mechanism to that 
produced by inflation, is given by (140/N)(VSV) [9, 10] 
where N denotes the number of components of the self-
ordering scalar field (presumed to be large and definitely 
greater than three), V„, is the symmetry breaking scale for 
the self-ordering field and V, is the scale of inflation. We 
need V, < Vi to ensure that symmetry breaking occurs 
after inflation (otherwise evidence of it would be oblit-
erated by inflation). This inequality constrains the ratio 
J. (v) The tensor to scalar ratio for inflation n = Ti/Si 
is the quantity of interest for inflationary models. In the
