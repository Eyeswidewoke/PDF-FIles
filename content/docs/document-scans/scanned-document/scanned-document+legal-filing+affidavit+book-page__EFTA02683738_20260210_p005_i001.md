that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation that occurs in reliance upon and in 
conformity with written information furnished by the Investor (or any agent of the 
Investor) expressly for use in connection with such registration by the Investor• provided 
further, however that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any 
preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of the Investor, from whom the 
person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased shares in the 
offering, if a copy of the prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company 
shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by 
or on behalf of such Investor to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, 
at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the shares to such person, and if the 
prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to 
such loss, claim, damage or liability. 
(b) 
To the extent permitted by law, the Investor will severally, and not 
jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its 
officers who has signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the 
Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and legal counsel 
and accountants for the Company, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to 
which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the Securities Act, the 
Exchange Act or any state securities laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or 
liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in 
each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance 
upon and in conformity with written information specifically furnished by the Investor 
expressly for use in connection with such registration which consists solely of the 
information specified in Section 4(d); and the Investor will reimburse any person 
intended to be indemnified pursuant to the foregoing, for any legal or other expenses 
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or defending any 
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity 
obligation of the Investor hereunder shall not in any event exceed the net proceeds 
received by the Investor from the offering giving rise to such liability. 
(c) 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the 
commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified 
party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party shall 
deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the 
indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the 
indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly 
noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to each party; 
provided however that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties 
that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain 
one separate counsel, with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the 
indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained 
by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing 
interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such 
counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying 
party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if materially 
prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of 
any liability to the indemnified party, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the
