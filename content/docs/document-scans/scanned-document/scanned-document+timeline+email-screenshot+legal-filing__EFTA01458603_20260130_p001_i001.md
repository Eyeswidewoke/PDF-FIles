Long or short, Hamish Mackenzie? 
The Head of Infrastructure, Europe & Debt, looks at this interesting sector 
Are valuations for large unlisted infrastructure businesses rising? 
Ken Large. mature infrastructure businesses are currently 
attractive investments for institutional investors and sovereign 
wealth funds seeking yield. This, combined with high levels of 
"dry powder" (available funds) in large, global infrastructure 
funds and some aggressive capital dep€oyment has pushed 
up valuations at the top end of the market, lowering implied 
returns. Investors may want instead to focus on medium-sized 
investments and more complex satiation, where there is less 
competition for investment. 
Should Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues 
always be considered? 
gm Investment decisions that may result in environmental 
or other social issues pose a reputational risk to investors 
and ultimately to shareholder returns. The Deutsche Asset & 
Wealth Management Infrastructure team therefore evaluates 
potential ESG issues as part of risk management throughout 
the investment process. These may cover a wide range of topics 
from energy, water, emissions, and waste management to 
labor and health & safety - and need to he considered across 
the whole investment lifecycle. so we can be confident about an 
investment's longevity. 
Will new regulations impact European life insurance companies' 
infrastructure investments? 
The introduction of Solvency II in 2016 will affect how 
European life insurance companies consider infrastructure 
equity as an asset class. Recently, the European Insurance and 
Occupational Pension Authority (EIOPA) proposed reducing 
capital charges for infrastructure investment, something which 
could lead to insurance companies allocating more funds to 
infrastructure. There is still some uncertainty surrounding 
Solvency II, as proposed regulatory requirements arc yet to be 
fully phased in, but we believe that the introduction of more 
stringent regulatory requirements is likely to further support, 
rather than discourage, these companies' investment in 
infrastructure.

Can infrastructure investment be fully de-linked from political 
risk? 
Business exposure to political developments can vary 
significantly from one country (and sector) to another. Such 
risk can have a particular impact on infrastructure-investment 
returns, as revenue here can be dependent on a government 
contract or concession, or a regulatory framework. A mature 
regulatory framework, supported by an independent regulator 
seen in some European core markets (e.g. the U.K.) - can offer 
a degree of protection from political events and thus greater 
visibility on investment returns. Full delinking of returns from 
political risk is not always possible but a detailed understanding 
of regulation, developed through experience and often active 
long-term relationships with regulators, as well as of the political 
economy of the host country. is fundamental and can help 
mitigate such risk. 
Are megatrends important in the short term for infrastructure 
investment? 
BEM Aide from technological change, several other 
megatrends (for example involving social and environmental 
change) are likely to influence infrastructure investment in the 
medium to long term. But investors should he thinking about 
these factors now, due to the present-value implications of these 
longer-term trends.
