Op-Ed draft Last Version 
Jeff 
Sorry to disturb you. This is the right draft. It has certain slight but imp=rtant modifications. Please delete the previous 
one to avoid confusion. Thx= Best EB 
>>> The unfolding tragedy in Syria which already cost the lives of 75 thousa=ds had culminated these days with evidence 
of the use of nerve agents by th= Assad regime against his own citizens and the videotaped executions as wel= as 
canibalism in the name of God on behalf of the rebels. Have we said: "=ough neighbourhood " ? lives lost, red lines 
crossed but no coordinated pla=, in sight, to end it had yet emerged. 
>>> Beyond the human suffering three main risks are embedded in this situati=n: first, the very continuation of the 
blood spill in a place where blood r=venge is a cultural norm and the conflict already became a magnet for extre=ist 
groups complicates the ending of the bloodshed and increase the odds of=post Assad Syria ending up as a failing state, 
a new Lebanon at best or so=alia at worst. 
>>> Secondly, the possibility of much wider use of chemical weapons 
>>> grows wi=h every round of actual use, as the psychological thresholds and impact of e=ternal deterrence are waning 
out. And with it the prospect of chemical weap=ns in terrorists hands and the internal civil war deteriorating into much 
w=der regional conflict. A, deterioration can easily develop as a result of a=Syrian attempts to transfer advanced 
weapon systems to Hezbollah in Lebanon= as Israel is committed to block it. physically if necessary Thirdly,and probably 
more important, the intensive ,risky and resource d=manding dealing with the Syrian crisis might detract leaders from 
tackling t=e Iranian military nuclear program which in the long term is much more dang=rous. 
>>> Assad's armed forces are weak, and heavily attrited by the infighting . m=re than one player on the world stage or 
even in the region can destroy his=airforce and air defence within a relatively short timeframe. but thats won=t 
necessarily end the fighting or secure the CW arsenal. when one considers=the alternatives which had been raised:no fly 
zone to be imposed by US, Nat= orTurkish force separately or combined," cordon sanitaire'" for refugees a=ong the 
Turkish and Jordanian borders,US or Israeli attacks on the CW capab=lities i feel that at this stage all options should 
remain on the table but=worth a try at being avoided and the key to the shortest and life cost redu=ing path is not in any 
neighbour's hands ,but in Moscow. it could be argued=that under different set of early decisions and actions we would 
already ha= won the case over Assad. but that doesn't matter. answers should be given n=w,immediately, based on 
PRESENT situation. 
>>> 
>>> The Kremlin has at its disposal the leverages that can convince Assad to=leave and at least to stop fighting 
immediately as a first step towards it.=The Russian leaders are as clever as we are and fully understand that Assad=is 
doomed and lost legitimacy.lt is not too hard to asses why they are relu=tant to say it loudly at this stage.lf we want to 
see an end of fighting an= do not want to see Jabhat al Nosra or the likes running Syria added probab=y by years of 
bloody massacre of Alawites and others in a no man's land Syr=a we need Russia to be asked to lead the international 
effort to end it,wit= all other players supporting it. in a way a mirror image of what happened i= Libya, where Russia was 
asked to support an effort lead by the Europeans a=d backed by the US.. 
>>> The Kremlin ,for more than forty years,invested a lot of political capit=l,financial resources and prestige in the 
Assads dynasty.They still do. the=r readiness to keep their commitment to give him SA300 AD and improved rada=s for 
the Yakhont shore to sea missiles systems is worrying . in the past t=ey trained and equipped the Syrians.provided 
intelligence gathering capabil=ties, they know the CW units generals on first name basis . they perceived t=e naval 
outpost in Tartous and Latakia as strategically important for them.=and they are making an effort that we don't like, to 
protect those assets.w= should be realistic. the challenge is not to educate Russia. and even if w=uld try it it would end 
up impractical. its true in the other direction as w=ll/. they can't educate us/ the real challenge for both is to put an end
