Fraction of police workers, z 
Fig. 3. The functional dependence of colony efficiency. r,, on the fraction of 
workers that are policing. z. may take any one of many possibilities. 
of killing eggs, police workers are directly diminishing the number 
of potential offspring. In the process of identifying and killing 
nephews, police workers may also be expending energy that could 
otherwise be spent on important colony maintenance tasks (Cole, 
1986; Naeger et al.. 2013). Policing can also be costly if there are 
recognitional mistakes. i.e.. queen-laid eggs may accidentally 
be removed by workers. Recognitional errors could result in 
modifications to the sex ratio. which is an important extension of 
our model but is beyond the scope of this paper. 
We can also identify positive effects that policing may have on 
colony efficiency. It has been hypothesized that the eggs which are 
killed by police workers may be less viable than other male eggs 
(Velthuts et al., 2002: Pirk et al.. 1999: Gadagkar. 2004; Nonacs, 
2006), although this possibility has been disputed (Beekman and 
Oldmyd. 2005; Helantera et al.. 2006; Zanetre et al.. 2012). If less-
viable worker-laid eggs are competing with more-viable queen-laid 
male eggs, then policing may contribute positively to overall colony 
efficiency. Moreover, policing decreases the incentive for workers to 
expend their energy laying eggs in the first place (Foster and 
Ratnieks, 2001a; Wenseleers et al.. 2004a,b: Wenseleers and 
Ratnieks. 2006a). which could be another positive influence on 
colony efficiency. (However, the decrease in incentive for workers to 
reproduce due to policing would only arise on a short time scale if 
there is a facultative response to policing which is unlikely.) 
As another speculative possibility: Could it be that worker egg-
laying and subsequent policing acts as a form of redistribution 
within the colony? That is. suppose that it is better for colony 
efficiency to have many average-condition workers than to have 
some in poor condition and some in good condition. Suppose 
further, as seems realistic. that good-condition workers are more 
likely to lay eggs (which are high in nutritional content, of course). 
If the average police worker is of condition below the average egg-
laying worker, then worker egg-laying and policing serves to 
redistribute condition among the workers, improving overall col-
ony efficiency. 
The special case, where policing has no effect on colony effi-
ciency and which has informed the conventional wisdom, is 
ungeneric, because policing certainly has energetic consequences 
for the colony that cannot be expected to balance out completely. 
An early theoretical investigation of colony efficiency effects 
regarding invasion of dominant mutations that effect worker 
policing was performed by Ratnieks (1988). 
Although monotonically increasing or monotonically decreas-
ing functions r, are the simplest possibilities, these cases are not 
exhaustive. For example, a small or moderate amount of policing 
may be expected to improve colony efficiency. However, the pre-
cise number of police workers that are needed to effectively police 
the entire worker population is unclear. It is possible that a frac-
tion z < 1 of police workers can effectively police the entire 
population, and adding additional police workers beyond a certain 
point could result in wasted energy, inefficient use of colony 
resources, additional recognitional errors. etc. These effects may 
correspond to colony efficiency r, reaching a maximum value for 
some 0 < z <1. 
As another possibility, suppose that police workers, when their 
number is rare, directly decrease colony efficiency by the act of 
killing male eggs. It is possible that for some z c 1, police workers 
are sufficiently abundant that their presence can be detected by 
other workers. Assuming the possibility of some type of facultative 
response, the potentially reproductive workers may behaviorally 
adapt by reducing their propensity to lay male eggs, instead 
directing their energy at raising the queen's offspring. In this 
scenario, colony efficiency r, may reach a minimum value for some 
0<z<1. 
23. Main results for dominant police alleles 
We derive the following main results for dominant police 
alleles. If the queen mates with n males, then the a allele for 
policing can invade an A resident population provided the fol-
lowing "evolutionary invasion
(
 condition" holds:

When considering only one mutation. ro can be set as 1 without 
loss of generality. Why are the four parameters. rim. ruz, p", and 
p12, sufficient to quantify the condition for invasion of the mutant 
allele, a? Since we consider invasion of a. the frequency of the 
mutant allele is low. Therefore, almost all colonies are of type 
AA 0. which means a wild-type queen. M. has mated with n wild-
type males, A. and 0 mutant males, a. In addition, the colonies Aa, 0 
and M. I are relevant. These are all colony types that include 
exactly one mutant allele. Colony types that include more than one 
mutant allele (such as Aa.1 or AA 2) are too rare to contribute to 
the invasion dynamics. For an Aa.O colony, half of all workers are 
policing and therefore the parameters r1j2 and p1,2 occur in Eq. 
(1). For an AA.1 colony, 1/n of all workers are policing, which 
explains the occurrence of rim and p,,,, in Eq. (1). 
Next, we ask the convene question: What happens if a popu-
lation in which all workers are policing is perturbed by the 
introduction of a rare mutant allele that prevents workers from 
policing? If the a allele for worker policing is fully dominant, and if 
colony efficiency is affected by policing then a resident policing 
population is stable against invasion by non-police workers if the 
following "evolutionary stability condition" holds: 
ri 
 
(2 + 0)(2 + pi) +pa„_ ivamtn-2) 
> 
 
(2)
ran- mom 
2(2+n+npi ) 
What is the intuition behind the occurrence of the four para-
meters, r1. ran_ wop pi. and pan _ warn? The condition applies to 
a population in which all workers are initially policing. Note that. 
because the allele, a. for policing is fully dominant in our treat-
ment. non-policing behavior arises if at least two mutant A alleles 
for non-policing are present in the genome of the colony. which is 
the combination of the queen's genome and the sperm she has 
stored. To study the invasion of a non-policing mutant allele. we 
must consider all colony types that have 0,1, or 2 mutant A alleles: 
these are Oa. n; aa.n —1: Ao.n: aa. n —2; Ao.n-1; and M. n. The 
colonies aa,n: aa.n —1: Aa.n: aa.n —2: and Mae do not contain 
non-police workers: the efficiency of those colonies is r,, and the 
fraction of male eggs that originate from the queen in those 
colonies is pi. Both of these parameters occur in Eq. (2:. Colonies of 
type Aa.n - 1 produce a fraction of 1/(2r) non-police workers.
