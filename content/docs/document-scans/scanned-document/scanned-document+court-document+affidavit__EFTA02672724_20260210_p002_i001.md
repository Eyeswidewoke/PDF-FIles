AICPA - Debt Discharge Under Sec. 108: Pannerships vs. S Corps. 
10/24/13 12:33 PM 
individually in bankruptcy. Partners that exclude COD income from gross 
income must file Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge 
of Indebtedness (and Section 1082 Basis Adjustment), with their tax 
return and reduce their tax attributes per the ordering rules of Sec. 
:t?/.21f,!' 
108(b), as discussed later in this item. 
For an S corporation, the bankruptcy exclusion applies if the S 
„re,
corporation is under the jurisdiction of a court in a bankruptcy case and 
the debt discharge is granted by the court or as part of a court-approved 
plan. Any taxable income after the application of Sec. 108 is passed on to 
the shareholders as taxable income, without any stock basis adjustment 
for the excluded income. The S corporation files Form 982 to claim the 
exclusion and is required to reduce its tax attributes. 
Sec. 108(a)(1)(8): Insolvency 
If the taxpayer is not in bankruptcy, the insolvency exclusion may apply. 
For a partnership, insolvency is determined at the partner level, rather 
than the partnership level, by measuring all the partner's assets, including 
assets that are exempt from bankruptcy creditors, such as retirement 
accounts and principal residence equity, against the partner's liabilities. 
(For more, see Sullivan, "Measuring Insolvency Under Sec. 108.") The 
partner files Form 982 to claim the exclusion, and the tax attributes of the 
partner, not of the partnership, are reduced. 
Note that in the case of the bankruptcy exception, as well as the 
insolvency and qualified farm indebtedness exceptions discussed below, 
a partner can elect to reduce the basis of depreciable property before 
reducing tax attributes by electing to treat the partner's share of the 
partnership interest as depreciable property to the extent of the partner's 
interest in the depreciable property held by the partnership. This election 
requires the partnership to agree to make a corresponding reduction in 
the basis of the partnership property for that partner. 
For an S corporation, the determination of any inclusion or exclusion of 
COD income, and the corresponding tax attribute reductions, are made at 
the S corporation level rather than the shareholder level. COD income 
that is excluded from gross income does not pass through to the 
shareholders for income recognition or shareholder basis considerations. 
Sec. 108(a)(1)(C): Qualified Farm Debt 
If the taxpayer is not in bankruptcy or insolvent, the qualified farm 
exclusion may apply if: 
. TM dote vies incurred diteetly in the WNW. of taming. 
• ea least 50% of the tWeyer's rm. receipts For the preceding three tax years was annevtatie to tarns% end 
The lender is unrelated to the taxpayer end is actively end regvlarty engaged o re bus mess or landed money 
C. is a greetrarnent agency or InsewenbIrty 
The amount of COD income excludable is limited to the total adjusted tax 
attributes plus the aggregate bases of business property and property 
held for the production of income. 
For partnerships, the exclusion from gross income of qualified farm debt 
is made at the partner level rather than the partnership level and cannot 
exceed the sum of tax attributes and business and investment assets of 
the partner. The corresponding reduction in tax attributes occurs at the 
partner level. 
For S corporations, the exclusion of quatified farm debt from gross 
income is made at the S corporation level for S corporations engaged in 
the business of farming. S corporations claim the qualified farm debt 
exclusion by filing Form 982. Because the excluded qualified farm debt 
does not pass through to the shareholders and does not adjust their stock 
bases, the S corporation does not report it on Schedule K or K-1.
