We are currently the #1 advertiser in the Wholesome Natural market segment 
by a wide margin and one of the top advertised brands in 
the industry overall. However, we still have a significant opportunity to 
expand our brand awareness compared to brands with much longer 
histories in the marketplace. Based on our internal market research for 
BLUE, BLUE's "familiar aware" metric (which is a metric used to measure, 
with respect to any given brand, the level and quality of awareness of pet 
parents who have at least some knowledge of such brand) is just over half 
the level of the pet food brand with historically the largest media spend. 
We plan to continue to invest in advertising to increase our brand 
awareness and drive traffic to brick-and-mortar stores and eCommerce 
retailers where BLUE is sold. 
Our commitment to pet nutrition education is reflected in our approach to 
marketing, which has a strong call-to-action for pet parents to 
examine the ingredients in their pet food. We achieve this through our 
integrated marketing strategy and Pet Detective program. Our Pet Detectives 
interact meaningfully with tens of thousands of pet parents at stores around 
the United States and Canada every week as they shop for pet food, 
instead of just handing out coupons or samples. We believe our Pet Detective 
program enhances the in-store shopping experiences of our retail 
partners and provides us with the benefits of direct-to-consumer marketing 
without creating a conflict with our retail partners. We have a strong 
field management organization recruiting passionate pet parents to be Pet 
Detectives, training them and providing ongoing coaching and 
supervision. Our online reporting and training platforms help us keep in 
touch with them and supplement in-person training. We use a rigorous set 
of analytics to manage and optimize our Pet Detective program on a store-by-
store level. We believe our Pet Detective program is the largest of its 
kind run by any CPG company in the United States. More recently, as we focus 
on increasing our distribution in channels outside national pet 
superstores, we have been investing in sales and marketing capabilities and 
programs suited for these different channels such as in-store 
merchandising to differentiate our products in smaller footprint 
neighborhood stores and web marketing tools to increase our conversion of 
online 
traffic. We also continue to look for ways to strengthen our relationships 
with key influencers in the industry (e.g., veterinarians, store associates 
and trainers) to help generate more recommendations for BLUE. Based on our 
research, a veterinarian recommendation is the top factor in pet food 
brand selection, with over one in five pet parents choosing their pet food 
brand based on a veterinarian recommendation. Until recently, we had no 
material communication or engagement program with this important group of 
influencers. After a successful pilot in 2014, we have recently 
launched our new True Blue Veterinary program. As part of this initiative, 
we have started building a dedicated national detailing force exclusively 
focused on the veterinarian community, which we will continue to expand on a 
regional basis in the next few years. Our Veterinary Clinic 
Specialists focus on educating the veterinary clinic staff on pet nutrition 
and the BLUE brand and products, which we believe will lead to more
