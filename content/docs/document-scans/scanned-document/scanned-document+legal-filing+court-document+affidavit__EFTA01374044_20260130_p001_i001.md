(n) To act for the Partnership in all other matters. 
Section 3.03 Limitation of Liability; Indemnification. 
(a) The General Partner, the Investment Manager and their respective members, 
officers, employees and affiliates, and any person or persons designated pursuant to Section 
9.02 of this Agreement, shall not be liable for any loss (including losses due to trade errors 
caused by such persons) or cost arising out of, or in connection with, any act or activity 
undertaken (or omitted to be undertaken) in fulfillment of any obligation or responsibility under this 
Agreement, including any such loss sustained by reason of any investment or the sale or 
retention of any security or other asset of the Partnership, except that any person exculpated 
from liability under this Section shall not be exculpated from any liability arising from losses 
caused by his, her or its gross negligence, willful misconduct or violation of applicable laws. 
(b) The General Partner, the Investment Manager, their respective members, officers, 
employees and affiliates and each person designated pursuant to Section 9.02 (each an 
"Indemnitee") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership to the fullest extent 
legally permissible under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware, as amended from 
time to time, from and against any and all loss, liability and expense (including without limitation 
judgments, fines, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and reasonable attorney's fees) 
incurred or suffered by the Indemnitee in connection with the good faith performance by the 
Indemnitee of his, her or its responsibilities to the Partnership; provided, however, that an 
Indemnitee shall not be indemnified for losses resulting from his, her or its own gross negligence, 
willful misconduct or violation of applicable laws. The Partnership shall, in the discretion of the 
General Partner, advance amounts and/or pay expenses as incurred in connection with the 
indemnification obligation herein. In the event this indemnification obligation shall be deemed to 
be unenforceable, whether in whole or in part, such unenforceable portion shall be stricken or 
modified so as to give effect to this paragraph to the fullest extent permitted by law. The 
indemnification provided in this Section shall in no event cause any Limited Partner to incur any 
liability beyond the limited liability provided in Section 1.07. 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.03, nothing contained in 
this Agreement shall constitute a waiver by the Limited Partner of any of its legal rights under 
applicable law, including, without limitation, state or federal securities laws.
