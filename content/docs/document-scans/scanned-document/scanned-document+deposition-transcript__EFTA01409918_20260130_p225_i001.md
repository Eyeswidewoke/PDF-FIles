Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and 
serve as the foundation for our continued growth: 
Authentic Cuisine — A Culinary Journey to Brazil 
We provide our guests with an experience that is distinctly Brazilian, and 
our food is at the heart of that experience. Our traditional Brazilian 
cuisine has been passed down from generation to generation in Brazil and 
lives on in the way our gaucho chefs prepare, season and continuously 
fire-roast our meats utilizing the traditional cooking method of churrasco 
fire-roasted on skewers over an open flame to expose the natural 
flavors. Our entrée selection features a variety of carefully cooked and 
seasoned meats including Brazilian style cuts of beef such as the fraldinha 
and the picanha, our signature cut of steak, as well as other premium beef 
cuts such as filet mignon and rib eye, and lamb, chicken, pork and 
seafood items. Each cut is carved table-side by our gaucho chefs in a manner 
designed to both enhance the tenderness of each slice and meet our 
guests' desired portion size and temperature. At Fogo de Chao, every table 
is a chef's table. To complement our meat selection, a variety of 
sharable side dishes, including warm cheese bread, fried bananas and crispy 
polenta, are brought to each table and replenished throughout the meal. 
For guests preferring lighter fare, we also offer Brazilian-inspired a la 
carte seafood options, a "Market Table" only option and a selection of small 
plates. Our Market Table, which features a variety of gourmet side dishes, 
seasonal salads, Brazilian hearts of palm, fresh-cut vegetables, aged 
cheeses, smoked salmon and cured meats is immediately available once our 
guests are seated. We believe it pays homage to the kitchen tables of 
Southern Brazil where families share fresh produce and seasonal salads grown
