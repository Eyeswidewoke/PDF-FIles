EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT 
ALTHOUGH THE ACCESS FUND IS PERMITTED TO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TRADE 
COMMODITY FUTURES, SWAPS AND/OR OTHER COMMODITY INTERESTS (COLLECTIVELY, 
"COMMODITY INTERESTS"), THE GENERAL PARTNER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION 
WITH THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION ("CFTC") AS A COMMODITY 
POOL OPERATOR ("CPO") AND PLANS TO FILE WITH THE NATIONAL FUTURES 
ASSOCIATION (THE "NFA") A NOTICE OF EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION WITH THE 
CFTC AS A CPO PURSUANT TO CFTC RULE 4.13(a)(3). THEREFORE, UNLIKE A 
REGISTERED 
CPO, THE GENERAL PARTNER IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS 
WITH A CFTC COMPLIANT DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT, NOR IS IT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE 
INVESTORS WITH CERTIFIED ANNUAL REPORTS THAT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF 
CFTC RULES APPLICABLE TO A REGISTERED CPO. IN ADDITION, BY VIRTUE OF ITS 
RELIANCE ON CFTC RULE 4.14(a)(3), THE GENERAL PARTNER WILL BE EXEMPT PURSUANT 
TO CFTC RULE 4.14(a)(5) FROM REGISTRATION WITH THE CFTC AS A COMMODITY 
TRADING ADVISOR ("CTA") WITH RESPECT TO ADVICE THAT IT PROVIDES TO THE ACCESS 
FUND, AND AS SUCH IT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY CERTAIN DISCLOSURE AND 
OTHER REQUIREMENTS UNDER CFTC RULES. THE CFTC DOES NOT PASS UPON THE 
MERITS OF PARTICIPATING IN A POOL OR UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF AN 
OFFERING MEMORANDUM. CONSEQUENTLY, THE CFTC HAS NOT REVIEW OR APPROVED 
THIS OFFERING OR THIS MEMORANDUM. 
THE GENERAL PARTNER WILL RELY UPON THE EXEMPTION FROM CPO REGISTRATION 
UNDER CFTC RULE 4.13(a)(3) (AND, CORRELATIVELY, THE EXEMPTION UNDER CFTC RULE 
4.14(a)(5)) BECAUSE (AMONG MEETING OTHER REQUIREMENTS): (I) THE INTERESTS IN 
THE 
ACCESS FUND ARE EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND ARE 
OFFERED AND SOLD WITHOUT MARKETING TO THE PUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES; (II) 
PARTICIPATION IN THE ACCESS FUND IS LIMITED TO "ACCREDITED INVESTORS" (AS 
DEFINED IN REGULATION D UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) AND "QUALIFIED PURCHASERS" 
(AS DEFINED IN THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT), AND (III) (A) AT ALL TIMES THE 
AMOUNT OF COMMODITY INTEREST POSITIONS TO WHICH THE ACCESS FUND IS 
DIRECTLY AND/OR INDIRECTLY EXPOSED DOES NOT EXCEED THE FOLLOWING LEVELS 
SPECIFIED IN CFTC REGULATION 4.13(a)(3)(ii): EITHER (X) THE AGGREGATE INITIAL 
MARGIN AND PREMIUMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH COMMODITY INTEREST POSITIONS 
WILL NOT EXCEED 5% OF THE LIQUIDATION VALUE OF THE ACCESS FUND; AND/OR (Y) 
THE AGGREGATE NET NOTIONAL VALUE OF COMMODITY INTEREST POSITIONS OF THE 
ACCESS FUND WILL NOT EXCEED 100% OF THE LIQUIDATION VALUE OF THE ACCESS 
FUND'S PORTFOLIO; AND/OR (B) THE GENERAL PARTNER DOES NOT KNOW AND COULD 
NOT REASONABLY KNOW THAT THE ACCESS FUND'S INDIRECT EXPOSURE TO 
COMMODITY INTERESTS DERIVED FROM CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNDERLYING FUND IN 
WHICH THE ACCESS FUND INVESTS EXCEED THE LEVELS SPECIFIED IN CFTC 
REGULATION 4.13(a)(3)(ii), EITHER CALCULATED DIRECTLY, OR THROUGH THE USE OF 
CFTC GUIDANCE ESTABLISHED IN APPENDIX A OF PART 4 OF THE CFTC'S REGULATIONS 
BEFORE SUCH APPENDIX WAS RESCINDED. TO THE EXTENT THE EXEMPTION CRITERIA 
CHANGES IN THE FUTURE, THE GENERAL PARTNER MAY SEEK TO COMPLY WITH ANY 
APPLICABLE DIFFERENT CRITERIA AND/OR OTHER EXEMPTIONS. 
AS A RESULT OF THE GENERAL PARTNER'S RELIANCE ON THE EXEMPTION FROM CPO 
REGISTRATION UNDER CFTC RULE 4.13(a)(3), AN INVESTOR THAT HAS 25% OR GREATER 
INTEREST IN THE ACCESS FUND AND OWNS OR CONTROLS COMMODITY FUTURES OR 
FUTURES OPTION CONTRACTS SUBJECT TO CFTC POSITION LIMITS WILL BE REQUIRED TO 
EFTA01395771
