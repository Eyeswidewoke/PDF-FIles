2.4.3 Duties, responsibilities and limitations of authority of WCI shall not be restricted, modified or 
extended without written agreement of the Owner and WCI with consent of the Contractor, which 
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
2.4.4 WCI shall be a representative of and shall advise and consult with the Owner (1) during 
construction until final payment to the Contractor is due and (2) as an Additional Service at the Owner's 
direction from time to time during the correction period described in the Contract for Construction. 
2.4.5 WCI shall visit the site on a regular basis and as required to become generally familiar with the 
progress and quality of the Work completed and to determine in general if the Work is being performed 
in accordance with the Contract Documents. However, WCI shall not be required to make exhaustive 
or continuous on-site inspections to check the quality or quantity of the Work. On the basis of on-site 
observations, WCI shall keep the Owner informed of the progress and quality of the Work, and shall 
endeavor to guard the Owner against defects and deficiencies in the Work. The Owner may agree to 
more extensive site representation with WCI as Additional Services described in Paragraph 3.2. 
2.4.6 WCI shall not have control over or charge of and shall not be responsible for construction 
means, methods, techniques, sequences or procedures, or for safety precautions and programs in 
connection with the Work, since these are solely the Contractor's responsibility under the Contract for 
Construction. WCI shall not be responsible for the Contractor's schedules or failure to carry out the 
Work in accordance with the Contract Documents. WCI shall not have control over or charge of acts or 
omissions of the Contractor, Subcontractors, or their agents or employees, or of any other persons 
performing portions of the Work. 
2.4.7 WCI shall at all times have access to the Work wherever it is in preparation or progress. 
2.4.8 Based on WCI's observations and evaluations of the Contractor's Applications for Payment, 
WCI shall review and certify the amounts due the Contractor. 
2.4.9 WCI's certification for payment shall constitute a representation to the Owner, based on WCI's 
observations at the site as provided in Subparagraph 2.4.5 and on the data compromising the 
Contractor's Application for Payment, that the Work, to the best of WCI's knowledge, information and 
belief, has progressed to the point indicated and that quality of the Work is in accordance with the 
Contract Documents. The issuance of a Certificate for Payment shall not be a representation that WCI 
has (1) made exhaustive or continuous on-site inspections to check the quality or quantity of the Work, 
(2) reviewed construction means, methods, techniques, sequences or procedures, (3) reviewed copies 
of requisitions received from Subcontractors and material suppliers and other data requested by the 
Owner to substantiate the Contractor's right to payment, or (4) ascertained how or for what purpose the 
Contractor has used money previously paid on account of the Contract Sum. 
2.4.10 WCI shall have authority to reject Work which does not conform to the Contract Documents and 
will have authority to require additional inspection or testing of the Work whenever, in WCI's reasonable 
opinion, it is necessary or advisable for the implementation of the intent of the Contract Documents.
