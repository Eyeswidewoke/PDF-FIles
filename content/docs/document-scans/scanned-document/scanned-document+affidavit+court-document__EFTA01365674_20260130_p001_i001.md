Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Holder of Income Notes shall 
be entitled to institute Proceedings or seek any other remedy hereunder unless all of the Senior 
Notes have been redeemed in full. 
Section 5.9 
Unconditional Rights of Noteholders to Receive Principal and 
Interest. 
Subject to Section 2.8(i), but notwithstanding any other provision in this 
Indenture, the Holder of any Note shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to 
receive payment of the principal of, interest on or distributions in respect of such Note as such 
principal, interest or distributions become due and payable in accordance with the Priority of 
Payments and Section 13.1, and, subject to the provisions of Section 5.8, to institute proceedings 
for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the 
consent of such Holder. Holders of Notes ranking junior to Notes still Outstanding shall have no 
right to institute proceedings for the enforcement of any such payment until such time as no Note 
ranking senior to such Note remains Outstanding, which right shall be subject to the provisions 
of Section 5.8, and shall not be impaired without the consent of any such Holder. 
Section 5.10 Restoration of Rights and Remedies. 
If the Trustee or any Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any 
right or remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned 
for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Noteholder, then and 
in every such case the Co-Issuers, the Trustee and the Noteholder shall, subject to any 
determination in such Proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions 
hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Noteholder shall continue 
as though no such Proceeding had been instituted (provided, that, if such Proceeding has been 
determined adversely to the Trustee or such Noteholder, nothing set forth herein shall be deemed 
to limit the doctrines of resjudicata and collateral estoppel as applicable). 
Section 5.11 Rights and Remedies Cumulative. 
No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the 
Noteholders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy 
shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and 
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The 
assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the 
concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. 
Section 5.12 Delay or Omission Not Waiver. 
No delay or omission of the Trustee or any Noteholder to exercise any right or 
remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a 
waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein or of a subsequent Event of 
Default. Every right and remedy given by this Article 5 or by law to the Trustee or to the 
Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by 
the Trustee or by the Noteholders, as the case may be.
