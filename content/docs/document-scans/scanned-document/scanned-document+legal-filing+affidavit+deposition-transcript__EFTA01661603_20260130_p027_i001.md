Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa... Page 27 of 32 
A former friend claimed Epstein backed out of a promise to reimburse him hundreds of thousands of 
dollars after their failed investment in Texas oil wells. A judge decided Epstein owed him nothing. 
"It's a bad memory. I would rather not have ever met Jeffrey Epstein," said Michael Stroll, the retired 
former president of Williams Electronics and Sega Corp. "Suffice it to say I have nothing good to say 
about him." 
Among the characteristics most attributed to Epstein is a penchant for women. 
He has been linked to Maxwell, a fixture on the high-society party circuits in both New York and 
London. Previous girlfriends are said to include a former Ms. Sweden and a Romanian model. 
"He's a lot of fun to be with," Donald Trump told New York magazine in 2002. "It is even said that he 
likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, 
Jeffrey enjoys his social life." 
Investigation leads to Epstein 
Although he was not a frequenter of the Palm Beach social scene, he made his presence felt. Among his 
charitable donations, he gave $90,000 to the Palm Beach Police Department and $100,000 to Ballet 
Florida. 
In Palm Beach, he lived in luxury. Three black Mercedes sat in his garage, alongside a green Harley-
Davidson. His jet waited at a hangar at Palm Beach International Airport. At home, a private chef and a 
small staff stood at the ready. From a window in his mansion, he could look out on the Intracoastal 
Waterway and the West Palm Beach skyline. He seemed to be a man who had everything. 
But extraordinary wealth can fuel extraordinary desires. 
In March 2005, a worried mother contacted Palm Beach police. She said another parent had overheard a 
conversation between their children. 
Now the mother was afraid her 14-year-old daughter had been molested by a man on the island. 
The phone call triggered an extensive investigation, one that would lead detectives to Epstein but leave 
them frustrated. 
Palm Beach police and the state attorney's office have declined to discuss the case. But a Palm Beach 
police report detailing the criminal probe offers a window into what detectives faced as they sought to 
close in on Epstein. 
Detectives interviewed the girl, who told them a friend had invited her to a rich man's house to perform 
a massage. She said the friend told her to say she was 18 if asked. At the house, she said she was paid 
$300 after stripping to her panties and massaging the man while he masturbated. 
Police interview 5 alleged victims 
The investigation began in full after the girl identified Epstein in a photo as the man who had paid her. 
Police arranged for garbage trucks to set aside Epstein's trash so police could sift through it. They set up 
a video camera to record the comings and goings at his home. They monitored an airport hangar for
