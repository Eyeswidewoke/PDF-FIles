Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM Document 14-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010 Page 5 of 5 
AO &SA (Rev. 01eO9) Subpoena to Testify at a Nominee, or to Produce Documents in a Civil Action (Per 3) 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 (c), (d), and (e) (Effective 12/1/07) 
(c) Protecting a Person Subject to a Subpoena. 
(I) Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions. A party or 
attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take 
reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a 
person subject to the subpoena. The issuing court must enforce this 
duty and impose an appropriate sanction — which may include lost 
earnings and reasonable attorney's fees — on a party or attorney 
who fails to comply. 
(2) Command to Produce Materials or Pent* Inspection. 
(A) Appearance Not Required. A person commanded to produce 
documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or 
to permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the 
place of production or inspection unless also commanded to appear 
for a deposition, hearing, or trial. 
(B) Objections. A person commanded to produce documents or 
tangible things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or 
attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to 
inspecting, copying, testing or sampling any or all of the materials or 
to inspecting the premises — or to producing electronically stored 
information in the form or forms requested. The objection must be 
served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 
days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made, the 
following rules apply: 
(i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving 
party may move the issuing court for an order compelling production 
or inspection. 
(ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and 
the order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party's 
officer from significant expense resulting from compliance. 
(3) Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena 
(A) When Required. On timely motion, the issuing court must 
quash or modify a subpoena that: 
(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; 
(ii) requires a person vrto is neither a party nor a party's officer 
to travel more than 100 miles from where that person resides, is 
employed, or regularly transacts business in person — except that, 
subject to Rule 45(c)(3XIIXiii), the person may be commanded to 
attend a trial by traveling from any such place within the state where 
the trial is held; 
(III) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if 
no exception or waiver applies; or 
(iv) subjects a person to undue burden. 
(B) When Permitted. To protect a person subject to or affected by 
a subpoena, the issuing court may, on motion, quash or modify the 
subpoena if it requires: 
(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, 
development, or commercial information; 
(ii) disclosing an unretained expert's opinion or information that 
does not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from 
the expert's study that was not requested by a party; or 
(iii) a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer to incur 
substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial. 
(C) Specifying Conditions as an Alternative. In the circumstances 
described in Rule 45(c)(3)(0), the court may, instead of quashing or 
modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under 
specified conditions if the serving party: 
(I) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that 
cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and 
(II) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably 
compensated. 
(d) Duties in Responding to a Subpoena. 
(1) Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information. 
These procedures apply to producing documents or electronically 
stored information: 
(A) Documents. A person responding to a subpoena to produce 
documents must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary 
course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to 
the categories in the demand. 
(B) Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not 
Specified. If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing 
electronically stored information, the person responding must 
produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or 
in a reasonably usable form or forms. 
(C) Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One 
Form. The person responding need not produce the same 
electronically stored information in more than one form. 
(D) Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information The person 
responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored 
information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably 
accessible because of undue burden or cost On motion to compel 
discovery or for a protective order, the person responding must show 
that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue 
burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless 
order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows 
good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(bX2)(C). The 
court may specify conditions for the discovery. 
(2) Claiming Privilege or Protection. 
(A) Information Withheld A person withholding subpoenaed 
information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to 
protection as trial-preparation material must: 
(i) expressly make the claim; and 
(Ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, 
communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without 
revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the 
parties to Ingres the claim. 
(B) Information Produced If information produced in response to a 
subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-
preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any 
party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. 
After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or 
destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use 
or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take 
reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it 
before being notified; and may promptly present the information to 
the court under seal for a determination of the claim. The person 
who produced the information must preserve the information until 
the claim is resolved. 
(e) Contempt. The issuing court may hold in contempt a person 
who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the 
subpoena. A nonparty's failure to obey must be excused if the 
subpoena purports to require the nonparty to attend or produce at a 
place outside the limits of Rule 45(cX3XA)(ii).
