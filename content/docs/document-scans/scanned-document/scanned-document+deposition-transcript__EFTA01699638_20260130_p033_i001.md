824 F.Supp. 330 
(Cite as: 824 F.Supp. 330, *334) 
contends that, just as the federal government has an 
interest in protecting the secrecy of federal grand 
jury material, the state has an interest in protecting 
state grand jury material from disclosure. 
Thus, 
the District Attorney argues that, in order to show 
proper deference to the State's interest in the 
confidentiality of the grand jury records, the United 
States should be required to move initially for 
disclosure before the presiding state court judge. 
The Court finds that no such requirement exists. 
[7] The Court recognizes that "policies of comity 
and federalism require some deference to the 
objective 
sought 
to 
be 
achieved 
by state 
confidentiality provisions." 
In re Grand fray 
Subpoena for New York State Income Tar Records, 
468 F.Supp. at 577. 
The basic purposes of the 
state grand jury secrecy laws in question are: (1) to 
prevent an accused from escaping before he is 
indicted: (2) to prevent tampering with witnesses; 
and (3) to protect an accused person who is not 
indicted from unwarranted exposure. 
People v. 
McAdoo, 45 Misc.2d 664, 257 N.Y.5.2d 763, 
ord. 51 Misc.2d 263, 272 *335 N.Y.S.2d 412, 
cen. denied, 386 U.S. 1031, 87 S.Ct. 1479, 18 
L.Ed.2d 592 (1967). 
In this case, compliance with the federal grand jury 
subpoena will not subvert New York's interest in 
maintaining the secrecy of grand jury proceedings 
because federal grand jury proceedings are also 
conducted secretly. 
The secrecy requirements of 
Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e), will adequately ensure that 
none of the purposes of the state grand jury secrecy 
laws are undemtned by compliance with the federal 
grand jury subpoena. 
See In re New York Grand 
Jury Subpoena for State Income Tar Records, 468 
F.Supp. at 577-78; see also United Stares v. Field, 
532 F.2d 404, 407-08 (5th Cir.1976), cen. denied, 
429 U.S. 940, 97 S.Q. 354, 50 L.Ed.2d 309; In re 
Grand Jury Empaneled Jan. 21, 1975, 541 F.2d at 
377-78. 
Moreover, it is important to note that comity is a 
policy which must be balanced against "the 
necessity of thorough grand jury investigations into 
violations of federal law." 
In re Grand Jury 
Subpoena for New York State Income Tax Records. 
46S F.Supp. at 577. 
In this case, the subpoenaed 
documents are necessary to the federal grand jury 
investigation. 
Thus, the policy of comity must 
yield to the constitutional right and duty of the 
federal grand jury to conduct a broad investigation.

Finally, the District Attorney contends that the 
motion to quash should be granted because the 
subpoenaed materials are privileged. 
Specifically, 
the District Attorney argues that the state grand jury 
secrecy law creates a federal privilege under 
Federal Rule of Evidence 501. 
The Court finds 
this argument without merit. 
[8] Evidentiary privileges protect confidential 
communications 
between 
persons 
in 
special 
relationships from disclosure. By their very nature 
they impede the search for the truth and are 
therefore generally disfavored. Trammel v. United 
States, 445 U.S. 40, 50. 100 S.Ct. 906, 912, 63 
L.Ed.2d 186 (1980); Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 
153. 99 S.Ct. 1635. 60 L.Ed.2d 115 (1979); 
United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709-10, 94 
S.O. 3090, 3108- 09, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974). 
Accordingly, the party asserting a privilege bears 
the burden of proving the applicability of the 
privilege," In re Bevil!, Bressler & Schulman Asset 
Management Corp., 805 F.2d 120, 126 (3d 
Cir.1986), and privileges, "whatever their origins 
... [should] not [be] lightly created or expansively 
construed." Nixon, 418 U.S. at 710, 94 S.O. at 
3109. 
(9) When faced with a claim that a grand jury 
should be denied evidence because of privilege, the 
reviewing court must weigh the potential harm from 
disclosure against the benefits of disclosure. 
American Civil Liberties Union of Miss., Inc. V. 
Finch, 638 F.2d 1336, 1343 (5th Cir.1981). In this 
case, the federal grand jury is investigating possible 
violations of federal criminal civil rights laws by 
police officers of the Buffalo Police Department. 
As fully explained in the United States' in camera 
statement of facts, the subpoenaed documents are. 
vital t6 the grand jury investigation and arc not 
simply needed to assess credibility of potential 
witnesses. 
In addition, the information sought to 
be obtained from the subpoenaed material is not 
otherwise available since the police officers are 
unwilling to talk to the FBI. Thus, the grand jury 
may not be able to learn the truth of the allegations 
without the subpoenaed material. 
On the other side of the scale, the potential harm 
from disclosure of the state grand jury material is 
minimal. 
Because Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e) limits 
disclosure of federal grand jury material, the
