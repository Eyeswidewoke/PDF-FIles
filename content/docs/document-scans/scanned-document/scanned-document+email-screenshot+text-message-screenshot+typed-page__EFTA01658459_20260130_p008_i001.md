world have been producing online propaganda materials specifically designed to target 
Americans. `They reach out to American audiences and plant ideas on how to conduct attacks 
without necessarily acquiring the materials,' Johnson told VOA, adding that `AQAP published 
Inspire Magazine, which was written and packaged for a Western audience, particularly 
Americans." Clark's arrest "His arrest was the result of cooperation between the FBI's Joint 
Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) and other law enforcement agencies, U.S. officials said. `Today's 
plea by Mr. Clark is yet one more example of the resolve of the FBI's JTTF in New York, and our 
many law enforcement partners, to protect this city and our citizens from the danger of lone 
wolf attacks,' FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr., said in a statement on Monday." 
Newsday (NM (8/10, Planas, 932K) reports, "Officials said Clark called for lone wolf 
attacks in New York City after pledging his allegiance to ISIS twice in 2019. Clark first did so in 
July 2019, to ISIS' then-leader Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi. He did so again, officials said, in 
October 2019, to ISIS' new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi, who became the 
organization's leader following al-Baghdadi's death. `Beginning in at least March 2019, Clark 
disseminated ISIS propaganda through, among other avenues, encrypted chat rooms intended 
for members, associates, supporters, and potential recruits of ISIS,' authorities said. `Clark's 
propaganda included among other things, calls for ISIS supporters to commit lone wolf attacks 
in New York City."

Senate Panel Subpoenas FBI Records On 2016 Russia Probe. 
Politico (8/10, Swan, 4.29M) reports Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Sen. Ron 
Johnson (R-Wis.) "has issued the first subpoena of his Senate probe into the origins of special 
counsel Robert Mueller's investigation: to FBI Director Christopher Wray." According to Politico, 
the subpoena "demands documents but not testimony. Specifically, it asks for `all documents 
related to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation' — the FBI's counterintelligence probe into 
Russian interference in the 2016 US election." Johnson "also released a lengthy letter detailing 
the origins of his probe and criticizing the reaction it has garnered from media reports and 
Democrats." 
Johnson said on Twitter, "Democrats have initiated a coordinated disinformation campaign 
in an effort to personally attack myself and Sen. @ChuckGrassley, but this will not obstruct our 
investigation. We will find the truth and get answers for the American people." Johnson also 
tweeted, "Today, I have released an open letter regarding the Democrats' combative and false 
comments regarding my committee's investigation." 
The Washington Times (8/10, Sherfinski, 492K) notes Johnson wrote, "Chairman [Charles 
E.] Grassley and I will not be deterred by the false accusations despicably being made by 
individuals with strong political biases and motivations. ... Our investigation has been, and will 
continue to be, undertaken with the greatest integrity and transparency. We intend to 
determine and reveal the truth." 
The Washington Examiner (8/10, Dunleavy, 448K) reports Johnson also stated, 
"Democrats and many in the media have mainly focused their criticism of our investigation on 
the Biden component of our oversight. ... They have once again decided to weaponize a false 
`Russian disinformation' narrative as a tool for attacking their political opponents." 
The Washington Post (8/10, Hamburger, 14.2M) reports the FBI "said in a statement it has 
received the subpoena and has `already been producing documents and information to the 
Senate Homeland Security Committee, which are directly responsive to this subpoena. As 
always, the FBI will continue to cooperate with the Committee's requests, consistent with our 
law enforcement and national security obligations." The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (8/10, 
Gilbert, 632K), among other news outlets, also reports the story.
