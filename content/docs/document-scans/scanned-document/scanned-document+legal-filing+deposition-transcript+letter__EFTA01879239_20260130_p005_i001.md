disappeared. The survivors are generally not inclined to feel implicated in the industry's wider 
collective problems. Mr Diamond always seemed to hint at the indignation of an executive whose 
bank had survived the banking crisis without direct government support and who felt he had little to 
answer for, at least until his employees' malpractice made this untenable. This is part of what made 
him such a lightning rod and figure of resentment for many politicians. 
The political fallout 
How will this play out politically? The UK's Labour opposition has clearly judged that there is 
mileage in a renewed campaign against the bankers. However, although Labour supports a 
tightening of the government's proposed rules on derivatives inside the ringfence for British retail 
banks proposed for 2013, its ultimate aim is not a particular regulatory outcome but something 
closer to a moral posture on capitalism. Labour leader Ed Miliband has broadly disowned the 
banking record of the labour government before 2010 and has put a "better, improved capitalism" 
at the heart of his election platform. This is achieving some resonance in the media. His aim is to 
use a moral and ethical critique of banking as a way of differentiating himself and the Labour party 
both from its own past and the Conservative-led Coalition government. The Coalition government 
inevitably will be forced to cover the same ground. 
The Conservative party is much less inclined to make a moral issue of banking, still less of capitalism 
more widely. However, most of the very small number of genuinely forensic critics of the banking 
sector in the UK Parliament are Tories, and often individuals with financial services backgrounds. 
The Chancellor George Osborne currently seems more inclined to use the LIBOR issue as an 
opportunity to attack Labour's record in government, but if other banks are fined and the 
Parliamentary enquiry is highly critical, then he will have to tack to stay close enough to the public 
mood. His own backbenchers have already started to grumble that he has misjudged the LIBOR 
scandal by playing it for politics rather than a question of principle and policy. 
For an industry that is used to justifying its social role largely in terms of taxes paid and jobs created, 
this is difficult territory. Assuming that banks accept that there is a need seriously to tackle and talk 
about internal culture, providing evidence of this response is not easy. It will require bank leaders 
who are more visible, vocal and accountable, and internal management that is willing to pit the long 
term interests of institutions against the short-term culture of the trading floor. 
For boards, and in particular the many non-executive board members of banks charged with 
providing external oversight of institutional conduct and compensation, this adds both additional 
responsibility and additional exposure. It will require a keen political ear. But it will also require 
politicians and regulators to engage in a more subtle debate about culture. And care by politicians 
that their desire to curb unacceptable behaviour does not spill over into a threat to the existence 
and competitiveness of the banking sector as a whole. 
By falling on his sword Mr Diamond has created the possibility of a rapprochement between his 
bank and British political opinion formers. The bigger issue for the bank he leaves behind and others 
like it is how — or if — it is possible to rebuild political and regulatory confidence in the kind of 
financial markets businesses he dedicated his career to building and the people who run and profit 
from them.
