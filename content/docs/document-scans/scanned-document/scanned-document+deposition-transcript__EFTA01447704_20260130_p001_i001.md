Derivatives are financial transactions based upon one or more predetermined market factors where periodic 
payments (or a one-time lump-sum payment) are made by each of the parties to the transaction based upon 
the value of the market factor or factors. The amount of the payment(s) will either be set at a fixed 
amount or fluctuate as the value of the underlying market factor fluctuates. The underlying market 
factors are items or variables which are subject to market fluctuations; for example, interest rates, 
currency exchange rates, assets, stock prices, stock index levels, commodities or a combination of one or 
more of these factors. Derivatives are normally used either as a hedging device or as an investment 
vehicle. Over the counter (OTC) derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, 
market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. In certain transactions, you could lose your entire 
investment or incur unlimited loss. 
OTC options are issued by a counterparty, may not be traded in the secondary market and may not be 
standardized in their terms. Over-the-counter ("OTC") options transactions involve numerous risks 
including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. In certain transactions, you 
could lose your entire investment or incur unlimited loss. You should understand the counterparty and 
credit risk, liquidity, marketability, settlement styles and pricing of any OTC option before transacting 
and you should discuss with your professional tax, legal, accounting and other advisor(s) as you deem 
appropriate, how a transaction may affect you. In any discussion of a proposed transaction we would act 
at arm's length and not in any advisory or fiduciary capacity.
