If you have ever experienced sexual as=ault or harassment, you know that one of the cruellest things about these acts is 
the way that they entangle, and attempt to contaminate, all of the best things about you. If you're sweet and friendly, 
you'll think that it'= your fault for accommodating the situation. If you're tough, well, you might as we=l decide that it's 
no big deal. If you're a gentle person, th=n he knew you were weak. If you're talented, he thought of you as an equal. 1= 
you're ambitious, you wanted it. If you're savvy, you knew =t was coming. If you're affectionate, you seemed like you 
were asking for=it all along. If you make dirty jokes or have a good time at parties, then why get moralistic? If you're 
smart, there's got to be some=way to rationalize this. 
When you are a young woman, and you believe in your=own worth and personhood and agency, it can be hard, despite 
the clichés that govern this situation, to understand that an older man who takes an interest in you does not necessarily 
share these beliefs. And, of course, young women are not the only victims of such crimes. But this is a basic and familiar 
pattern: a powerful man sees you, a woman who is young and who thinks she might be talented, a person who 
conveniently exists in a female body, and he understands that he can tie your potential to your female body, and 
threaten the latter, and you will never be quite as sure of the former again. 
Afterward, you are r=rely presented with even a single good option. Stay silent and you have acquiesced to whatever 
happened. Tell a friend and nothing much will be done. Come forward to an authority figure and you'll face unfair 
consequences: people will be uncomfortable aroun= you, perceiving ulterior motives; people will look for reasons that 
this happened to you, specifically; maybe you simply won't be believed. =here will be retribution—the power dynamic in 
these situations makes it = foregone conclusion. Men like Harvey Weinstein prey on women who are inexperienced 
enough that they can be penalized if they say no and implicated if they give in. 
In Ronan Farrow's account of Weinstein's alleged decades-long pattern of cold, angry, vicious, sexually predatory 
behavior, this side=of sexual victimization is particularly palpable in the actress Asia Argento's story. Argento alleges 
that, in 1997, she was told she wa= attending a Miramax party but was brought to a hotel room that was empty except 
for Weinstein. He complimented her work, and then came out of the bathroom wearing just a robe, carrying lotion. 
When she reluctantly agreed to give him a massage, he pulled up her skirt and forcibly performed oral sex on her as she 
pleaded with him to stop. "It was = nightmare," she told Farrow. Eventually, she says, she stopped prot=sting and 
feigned pleasure to make the encounter end faster. During the event and after, she says, she felt guilty for not physically 
fighting off his big naked body. Later on, she yielded to his pursuit and had consensual sex with him on multiple 
occasions. 
In the story, it is clear that Weinst=in, through this initial encounter, immediately and permanently altered Argento's life 
and self-perception. She told Farrow that oral sex is "ruined" =or her, and she described herself as "damaged." "I am a 
fucking=fool," she said. The most crushing thing, reading the account, is that Argento seems to speak with such a 
minimum of rancor. In fact, most of the women who have spoken up about Weinstein—a group that includes, among 
many others,=Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette, Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan

of diminishment, a sense of undeserved yet inescapable remorse.
