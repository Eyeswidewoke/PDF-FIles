Steve Cohen vs. the Federal Wrecking Ball 
The Federal Wrecking Ball 
By Edward Jay Epstein 
A bedrock principle of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence is that there is a =resumption of innocence, This should mean that if 
the government fails =o find incriminating evidence in an exhaustive investigation, they =annot punish a person for a 
crime or confiscate his property. Yet, =rosecutors have found ways to bypass the absence of evidence when it =omes to 
Wall Street, Consider the case of Steven A. Cohen, the founder =nd owner of SAC Capital Advisors, a ten-billion group of 
hedge funds, =o one can doubt that the six year investigation of him for inside =rading qualifies as exhaustive. 
It originated with a highly-plausible theory that his =onsistently high trading profits resulted from an orchestrated 
scheme =f inside trading. To substantiate it, the SEC and Department of =ustice sought the requisite evidence. They 
subpoenaed or otherwise =anaged to obtain 375 million pages of the trading records, =orrespondence and other 
documents of Cohen and his SAC funds. This =assive trove of documents, however, did not yield any usable evidence 
=hat Cohen was involved in inside trading. The Feds also employed =urreptitious means to attempt to find evidence to 
substantiate their =heory, including planting court-approved listening devices in =ohen's home to intercept his 
conversations, including ones with his =op lieutenants used plan his funds' weekly trading strategy, and =lanting a mole 
in his organization. The mole was Richard C.B Lee, a =ormer SAC employee, who, wearing a wire, proposed various 
"trading =deas" based on inside information to Cohen ( presumably scripted by =is Fed handlers.). Despite the 
provocations, none of the bugging =roduced any usable evidence against Cohen. Finally, as is not uncommon =n Wall 
Street cases, prosecutors attempted to induce former and =resent SAC employees to testify against Cohen, including 
eight who had =een themselves charged with using inside information, Even though =ive of them agreed to cooperate 
with the government, none were able to =rovide evidence that Cohen had known of their alleged inside trading, =ven 
wen by proffering it they might have spared them prison sentence. =As a result, the government had no evidence to 
support its theory in =ourt. Despite this embarrassing absence of evidence against Cohen, the =rosecutors did not give 
up. Instead, it shifted to plan B: targeting =ohen's corporation, SAC Capital in a two pronged attack. 
The first prong was a Grand Jury indictment of Cohen's corporate =Ito ego, SAC Capital, for security and wire fraud. It 
alleged that =AC had encouraged its employees to seek illegally-obtained data by =roviding them with profit-sharing and 
then not properly enforcing its =wn rules against using inside information. SAC Capital, which denies =his allegation, 
will have its day in court to defend itself. 
The second prong was a civil forfeiture complaint charging that =AC Capital engaged in a money-laundering 
conspiracy. Such civil =orfeiture complaints began as means of destroying the cash resources =f drug traffickers. It 
allows the government to seize all the assets =f a suspect without even proving that a crime has been committed. =ince 
it is technically leveled against the asset itself, the =overnment need only to assert is that the "preponderance of the 
=vidence" shows that it is subject to forfeiture. When this complaint =s tied to money-laundering it can be disastrous for 
a financial =nstitution because the government can freeze or seize all its assets, =ncluding those funds loaned to it.. In 
the case of SAC Capital, the =utative money-laundering stems from the allegation the illegal earning =ere investing in, 
and thereby intermingled with, SAC Funds. But even =f this occurred, was it the sort of money-laundering in which 
profits =rom an illegal enterprise are disguised as profits from a legal one? =one of the traders had to disguise their 
commissions, bonuses and =erformance compensation, nor did they represent them as anything other =han trading 
profits. But the government does not actually prove there =as money laundering since this a civil forfeiture complaint. 
The lethal part of the civil forfeiture complaint was its scope, =eeking not a specific amount but "any and all" assets 
of SAC =apital. At last count, according to its regulatory filings, SAC funds =eld some $51 billion in securities and loans 
from counter parties. To =e sure, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara currently is not seeking to =reeze these assets, a freeze
