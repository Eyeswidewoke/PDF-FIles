From: 
Ada Clapp 
This memorandum is addressed to you as Trustee of The Leon D. Black 1999 Life 
Insurance Trust *1 ("Trust #1) and The Leon D. Black 1999 Life Insurance Trust #2 
("Trust #2). Trust #1 and Trust #2 referred to collectively as the "Trusts." 
It outlines proposals for your consideration regarding the termination of the 
split dollar agreements between the Trusts and AIF IV Management Inc. ("AIF"). 
A. 
Background. 
To refresh your recollection, in 1999, Trust #1 purchased $50 million of 
insurance on Leon's life (the "single life policies") and Trust #2 purchased $100 
million of insurance on the joint lives of Leon and Debra (the "joint life 
policies"). Thereafter, each trust entered into a split dollar agreement (the 
"Agreements") with AIF, as Leon's employer. 
The Trusts may terminate the 
Agreements at any time. AIF has no right to terminate. 
Under the terms of the Agreements, each year, AIF must pay the premiums on all 
policies (the "Premiums"). Leon or the Trusts must repay AIF for the annual cost 
of current life insurance (the "Employee's Portion"). AIF has paid Premiums of 
roughly $1.8 million each year. Each year the Employee Portion is taxed to Leon 
as both compensation income and a deemed gift to the Trusts. For 2012, the 
Employee Portion was $104,132. When the policies mature by reason of the death 
of the insured(s), AIF is entitled to a refund of Premiums advanced. If, 
however, the Agreements terminate prior to the death of the insured(s) (e.g., 
because you, as Trustee, elect to terminate them), each Trust must repay AIF the 
lesser of Premiums advanced or the then cash surrender values of the policies 
held in such Trust. To secure the repayment obligation, the Trusts assigned 
their insurance policies to AIF as collateral. 
B. 
Rationale for Terminating the Agreements. 
As you will recall, the original rationale for implementing a split dollar 
insurance plan was to provide a tax efficient means by which funds could be 
available to satisfy a significant portion of the debts and estate taxes payable 
upon the death of the survivor of Leon and Debra. The original 1999 proposal by 
Roger Cammon of the Bryant Group anticipated retention of the policies until the 
death of the insured(s) and projected that the policies would be self-funding by 
2011. However, the policies have not performed as projected. The single life 
policies owned by Trust #1 are now "under water" (Premium advances exceed net 
cash surrender value) and absent a substantial (taxable) gift from Leon to Trust 
#1, Roger projected that Premium payments would need to continue for at least 10 
more years for these policies to be self-sustaining. Performance on the joint 
life policies owned by Trust #2 has improved but Premiums will still be required 
for a much longer period than originally projected. 
In addition, continuation 
of the Agreements requires Leon's continued payment of income and gift tax on the 
Employee's Portion, which amount will increase each year. 
In addition to poor policy performance, the split dollar arrangements no longer 
achieve the original objective, and therefore, do not warrant the additional 
expense required to maintain them. The $150 million death benefit will no longer 
come close to satisfying a substantial portion of the debts and estates taxes 
anticipated upon the death of the survivor of Leon and Debra. For the foregoing 
reasons, Leon's advisors suggest that you, as Trustee of the Trusts, consider 
terminating the Agreements. If you agree, they have outlined the below proposals 
for your consideration. 
C. 
Proposals to Terminate the Agreements. 
Because the Agreements were entered into prior to 2003, they are afforded special 
tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code and IRS Regulations. Accordingly, 
Leon's advisors believe that, if done properly, the Agreements could be 
terminated (or "rolled-out") without any adverse income or gift tax consequences. 
The proposals outlined below are designed to preserve this favorable tax 
treatment. Under the Agreements, upon roll-out during the life of the 
insured(s), each of the Trusts must repay AIF the lesser of Premiums advanced or
