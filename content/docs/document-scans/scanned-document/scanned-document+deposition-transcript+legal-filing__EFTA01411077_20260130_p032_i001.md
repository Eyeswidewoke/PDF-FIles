• our initial stockholder, officers, directors and director nominees 
have entered into letter agreements with us, a form of which has 
been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this 
prospectus forms part, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to 
waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares 
and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial 
business combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating 
distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder 
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination 
within 24 months from the closing of this offering (although they 
will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account 
with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete 
our business combination within the prescribed time frame). If we 
submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders 
for a vote, our initial stockholder has agreed to vote its founder 
shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering 
in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, we would 
need only 5,062,581 of the 13,508,080 public shares, or 37.5%, 
sold in this offering to be voted in favor of our initial business 
combination in order to have such transaction approved (assuming 
the over-allotment option is not exercised and no shares are 
purchased by such parties in this offering).

Transfer restrictions on founder shares 
Our initial stockholder has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of 
its founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the 
completion of our initial business combination or (B) the date on 
which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other 
similar transaction after our initial business combination that results 
in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their 
shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property (except 
as described herein under "Principal Stockholders—Transfers of 
Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants"). We refer to such 
transfer restrictions throughout this prospectus as the lock-up. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last sale price of our common 
stock equals or exceeds $12.08 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, 
stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for 
any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at 
least 158 days after our initial business combination, the founder 
shares will be released from the lock-up. 
Private placement 
warrants 
Our sponsor has committed, pursuant to a written agreement, to 
purchase an aggregate of 11,680,800 private placement warrants (or 
12,815,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), each 
exercisable to purchase one-half of one share of our common stock at 
$5.75 per half share, at a price of $0.50 per warrant ($5,800,000 in 
the aggregate or $6,407,500 in the aggregate if the over-allotment 
option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will occur 
simultaneously with the closing of this offering. The purchase price 
of the private placement warrants will be added to the proceeds from
