The attached note should be read in conjunction with the following text 
which forms an integral part thereof: 
Deutsche Bank does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research 
reports. Thus, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest 
that could affect the objectivity of this report. Investors should consider this report 
as only a single factor in making their investment decision. 
This report covers more than one security and was prepared by more than one analyst. 
The views expressed in this report accurately reflect the personal views of each 
contributor to this compendium report. In addition, each contributor has not and will 
not receive any compensation for providing a specific recommendation or view in this 
compendium report. 
The information and opinions in this report were prepared by Deutsche Bank AG or one of 
its affiliates (collectively "Deutsche Bank"). The information herein is believed to be 
reliable and has been obtained from public sources believed to be reliable. Deutsche 
Bank makes no representation as to the accuracy or completeness of such information. 
Deutsche Bank may engage in securities transactions, on a proprietary basis or 
otherwise, in a manner inconsistent with the view taken in this research report. In 
addition, others within Deutsche Bank, including strategists and sales staff, may take 
a view that is inconsistent with that taken in this research report. 
Opinions, estimates and projections in this report constitute the current judgement of 
the author as of the date of this report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions 
of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank has no 
obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient 
thereof in the event that any opinion, forecast or estimate set forth herein, changes 
or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Prices and availability of financial instruments 
are subject to change without notice. This report is provided for informational 
purposes only. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any 
financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target 
prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst judgement. 
As a result of Deutsche Bank's March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be 
covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these 
analysts may use differing methodologies to value the security; as a result, the 
recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not 
to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. 
In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks having a market cap 
smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy 
will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at 
http://gm.db.com to determine the target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all 
investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Stock 
transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and other factors. 
If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past 
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Deutsche Bank may with 
respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a 
principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis. 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through 
the Deutsche Bank entity in the investor's home jurisdiction. In the U.S. this report 
is approved and/or distributed by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., a member of the NYSE, 
the NASD, NFA and SIPC. In Germany this report is approved and/or communicated by
