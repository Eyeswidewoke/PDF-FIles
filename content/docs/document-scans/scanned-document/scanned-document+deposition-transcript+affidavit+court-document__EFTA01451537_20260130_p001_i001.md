SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
transactions of the Onshore Feeder Fund would be subject to the prohibited transaction 
provisions of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, which may restrict the Onshore 
Feeder Fund from engaging in certain transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to the 
Onshore Feeder Fund. 
Unlike the Onshore Feeder Fund, the Offshore Feeder Fund may be considered an ERISA 
plan asset entity within the meaning of ERISA, but since the Offshore Feeder Fund's sole 
purpose is to invest in the Onshore Feeder Fund, and no discretion is being exercised by the 
General Partner (in its capacity as general partner of the Offshore Feeder Fund) or the 
Offshore Feeder Administrator, and neither its general partner nor the Offshore Feeder 
Administrator will be considered a fiduciary to the ERISA plans invested through the 
Offshore Feeder Fund. The Department of Labor may disagree with this position, in which 
event the General Partner (and any other person with discretionary authority with respect to 
the assets of the Master Fund) could be treated as a fiduciary with respect to the portion of 
the assets of the Offshore Feeder Fund and the Onshore Feeder Fund deemed to be plan 
assets and all transactions of the Onshore Feeder Fund would be subject to the prohibited 
transaction provisions of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, which may restrict the 
Onshore Feeder Fund from engaging in certain transactions that may otherwise be 
beneficial to the Onshore Feeder Fund. 
See Section 3, "Regulatory and Tax 
Considerations — ERISA Considerations." 
Side Letters. The Feeder Funds and/or the General Partner may enter into other written 
agreements ("Side Letters") with one or more Limited Partners of the Feeder Funds. 
These Side Letters may entitle a Limited Partner to make an investment in a Feeder Fund 
on terms other than those described herein, in the LP Agreements, and in the Subscription 
Agreements. Any such terms, including with respect to (i) reporting obligations of the 
Feeder Funds, (ii) transfers to affiliates, (iii) withdrawal rights due to adverse tax or 
regulatory events, (iv) consent rights to certain LP Agreement amendments, (v) payment of 
Management Fees, or (vi) any other matters, may be more favorable than those offered to 
any other Limited Partners. If the Feeder Funds and/or the General Partner enter into a Side 
Letter entitling a Limited Partner to withdraw from a Feeder Fund, any election to 
withdraw by such Limited Partner may increase any other Limited Partners' pro rata 
Interest. 
The Master Fund and/or the Master Fund General Partner may also enter into Side Letters 
with the limited partners of the Master Fund (including the Onshore Feeder Fund) entitling 
certain limited partners to preferential terms in connection with their investment in the 
Master Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Master Fund Offering 
Memorandum or Master Fund Partnership Agreement, Limited Partners will not be 
entitled to the benefit of any Side Letters, and the Onshore Feeder Fund will not distribute 
copies of any Side Letters that it receives in its capacity as a limited partner of the Master 
Fund to its Limited Partners (including the Offshore Feeder Fund).
