Carry the TravelFunds® Card from American Express 
Whenever you travel, consider taking the prepaid, reloadable 
TravelFunds Card from American Express—instead of cash or debit 
cards. It's safer than cash and is a convenient way to carry money 
while you travel. Unlike debit cards, it's not linked to your bank 
account and you'll have access to valuable travel services such as 
passport/credit card replacement assistance.* 
Proof of TravelFunds Card purchase may be required. Credit card replacement assistance 
is for major bank-issued a-edt cards only (not retail store, gasoline, calling cards, etc.). 
'Fees for passport/credit card replacement are the sole responsibility of the customer. ATM 
fees apply. For complete Terms, visit vonv.amerIcanexpress.com/buytfc or call 
1-888-412-6945.
