develop as a standalone company. We believe that no one else in the category approaches the scale of our paid customer acquisition efforts. 
Monetization expertise: On a brand-by-brand basis, we continually test and customize our offerings to determine which features to offer for a fee and 
which features to offer for free. Over the course of our operating history, these tests have helped us develop significant expertise in maximizing 
revenue while maintaining a brand's ability to attract new users and maintain a vibrant and active community of users. We believe that our approach to 
monetization is more sophisticated than any of our single brands would have been able to develop on its own. 
Ability to monetize through advertising: Given the significant size and diversity of our user base, advertisers could reach an average of approximately 
59 million MAU across our brands for the quarter ended September 30. 2015. We offer advertisers the ability to customize their advertisements based 
on analytics we collect about user interests and behavior. We believe that our scale and analytics-driven marketing make us more attractive to 
advertisers as compared to our competitors. 
Commitment to product development: Each of our brands has a robust product roadmap. Product development and innovation are generally brand-
specific and significant resources are devoted to constant improvements of our various products. Accordingly, we have multiple product development 
teams working at any given time on a variety of features at a breadth that, we believe, could not be replicated by any of our single brands as 
standalone entities. 
Shared teaming: While maintaining each brand's unique character, we facilitate knowledge and experience sharing across our portfolio in the areas of 
marketing and customer acquisition, monetization and product development 
each brand generally is responsible for its own progress in these 
areas, the ability for each to quickly leverage the successes of other brands and avoid their failures, substantially increases the success rates for each 
brand in each of these key drivers of business performance. 
Demonstrated ability to incubate new businesses: We have a history of successfully introduang new dating brands. For example. OurTime was 
launched in 2011 and Tinder in 2012. We expect to continue to devote resources to developing new dating products and believe our industry expertise 
and significant cash flow provide a unique ability to succeed in this endeavor. 
Identifying opportunistic acquisitions: We have developed a core competency for identifying, acquiring. integrating and scaling businesses. Since 
January 2009, we have invested approximately 51.284.0 million to acquire 25 new brands for our dating portfolio, including OkCupid. Meetic. Twoo and 
PlentyOfFish. 
Our strategy 
We are pursuing the following principal strategies to grow our dating business: 
Focus on product development: We devote substantial resources to developing new features and functionalities for our products. We believe there are 
meaningful improvements that can be made to the efficacy and appeal of products in our category, both through existing and emerging technologies. 
Increasing product efficacy and appeal are two of the major drivers of increased category adoption. 
Become even more mobile: We are increasingly concentrated on mobile development. For the quarter ended September 30. 2015. pro forma for 
PlentyOffish, 73% of our new registrations were from a mobile device. We are currently allocating resources to more rapidly increase our mobile 
development, which we believe represents a significant growth opportunity for our business. 
Improve customer acquisition efforts: We continue to focus on building our traditional paid acquisition channels. including offline media, with the intent 
to reach new customers, increase the demand for dating products and drive repeat usage. Additionally, we are developing our expertise in paid mobile 
acquisition and digital video channels. Finally, vie are focused on expanding the virakty of our brands and maintaining a high rank in app stores. We 
believe we have the ability to expand our marketing reach over time.

Drive advertising revenue: Generating advertising revenue has historically not been a principal focus for us. As a result, we believe our advertising 
revenue is substantially below what we should be able to achieve. Part of our strategy is to meaningfully increase the sell-through at our Tinder brand. 
which is currently below 2% of available ad inventory. We believe that Tinder's strong user engagement, with an average of approximately 9.6 million 
daily active users during the month ended September 30, 2015, each spending, on average, more than 35 minutes per day using the product and 
"swiping," on average, through 145 user profiles per day, makes it a very attractive platform for advertisers. We also intend to meaningfully increase the 
percentage of ad Inventory on our other brands sold on a dkect basis. which currently is below 2% of total ad inventory sold. We believe that there is 
meaningful upside to our current revenue levels if we achieve these objectives. 
Dynamically monetize our brands: We will continue to optimize pricing and the bundle of tree and paid offerings for each brand. We also expect to 
continue to develop new features that will both improve the user experience and increase the number of people willing to pay for the use of our 
products. We believe that most of our products have the opportunity to increase both the percentage of users who are paid members and the amount 
that those users pay us over time. 
Continue to expand our portfolio: In the past, we have successfully completed acquisitions such as OkCupid, Meetic, Twoo and PlentyOfFish, as well 
as launched OurTime and Tinder. Each acquisition or new product launch has resulted in increased adoption levels either within a given geography or 
demographic. We intend to continue to pursue strategic opportunities in existing and new markets globally, and expect that additional growth will be 
generated through these pursuits. 
Leverage our portfolio: We believe we are only beginning to realize the benefits that ownership of multiple brands brings to our company. We intend to 
continue to optimize our operations across brands to reduce both fixed and variable costs, increase success rates in product development and 
customer acquisition and accelerate speed to market
