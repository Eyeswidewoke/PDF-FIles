ATTACHMENT A 
Toward Development of New Treatments for Obsessive-Compulsive and 
Comorbid Disorders 
Molecular dissection of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits 
controlling obsessive compulsive, depressive, and anxious behaviors in mammals 
September 2014 
Paul Greengard, Ph.D., and Nathaniel Heintz, Ph.D. 
Although the precise causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are still not known, a great deal of 
progress has been made over the last two decades in identifying brain circuits that are aberrant in this 
disorder. The consensus view that has emerged from functional imaging studies of OCD patients is that 
abnormal patterns of activity in circuits involving the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia, and the thalamus 
are characteristic features of OCD. This conclusion has been supported by deep brain stimulation studies 
that, although quite variable, indicate that stimulation at several nodes in these circuits can have a positive 
therapeutic effect in OCD. Additional support for the CSTC model has come from recent rodent studies of 
OCD, where it has been demonstrated that artificial stimulation in CSTC pathways can elicit persistent 
OCD-like behaviors, and that cortico-striatal synaptic defects cause similarly aberrant behaviors. 
Taken together, the available clinical and experimental data allow the conclusion that novel therapies that 
result in specific modulation of CSTC circuits should be developed, and that such therapies would have 
significantly increased efficacy and fewer side effects than current OCD therapies. Furthermore, one might 
reasonably infer that the generation of pharmacologies specific for different elements of this circuitry 
should result in effective therapies for even those OCD patients who are refractory to currently available 
treatments (e.g., Zoloft, Paxil, Anafranil, Prozac, etc.). While these studies of "core circuitry" and cell types 
altered in OCD are fundamental for progress in OCD treatment, it is clear that studies of the comorbidities 
associated with OCD (e.g. major depression (MD), anxiety disorders (AD)) will be required to fully 
understand and treat OCD. 
It has become clear in recent years that brain areas implicated in OCD, MD and AD overlap substantially. 
However, little is known regarding the molecular disturbances that occur in the cell types and circuits 
affected in each case, and whether these molecular signatures predict common, complementary or 
combinatorial approaches to treatment. In the opinion of Drs. Greengard and Heintz, the most powerful 
approach toward investigation of OO is to characterize the molecular properties of cell types comprising 
the CSTC circuits in mouse models of OCD, to expand these studies to include additional circuit elements 
implicated in comorbid disorders, and to perform detailed comparative analyses of the molecular 
phenotypes occurring in these cell types in the context of distinct but overlapping disorders. 
The Heintz and Greengard laboratories at Rockefeller University are uniquely positioned to lead the effort 
to develop novel therapies for OCD. Dr. Greengard has had a longstanding interest in the striatum and 
other basal ganglion circuit elements (his 2000 Nobel Prize was awarded in part for his pioneering research 
in this area). Dr. Heintz has led modern efforts to define each of the cell types in the complex circuitry of 
the brain, and to accelerate studies (such as those mentioned above) to identify specific cell types
