other counties may wish to learn from the Saudi experience in antiterrorism and other criminal rehabilitation through social media. However. 
social mediaborganized protests by Israelis due to economic hardship may possibly lead to greater Israel, compassion 
for Palestinian economic hardship under occupation. 
Lessons from Israel and Great Britain 
By mid-2011. the Israeli government faced public protests. which were brought about by widespread economic deprivation. Some estimate over 
a quarter million Israelis participated in protests at some pointbsimilarty 
organized by cell phone and social media, particularly Facebook.1 An editorial in 
Londonbs Financial Times stated, "a perception that too many people cannot make 
ends meet, or even live in outright poverty, motivates Israelis as it did Tunisians and 
Egyptians 
in January and February. . 
[I]t is evident that public spending on education and 
healthcare is low partly because the [Israeli] governmentbs military budget is so high. 
Nothing better illustrates how a peace deal with the Palestinians would benefit Israeli 
society as a whole. "2 Among the poorest are lsraelbs Arab citizens and orthodox 
Jews.3 Another commentator in the Financial Times points out that Israeli discontent is 
also caused to a significant extent by a widespread resentment that the country may be 
under 
the inf luence of powerful, small interest groups including Israeli settlers in the 
occupied territories: the "settlers . . . enjoy cheap, subsidized housing and benefit from 
public services that are far superior to those available to Israelis living inside 
the Green Line."4 
Such mounting evidence of resentment driven by social mediab4 Israelis inside Israel against Israeli 
settlers in the occupied territhtlesbrnay have a powerful, positive impact on the direction of Middle 
East 
peace. Palestinians living under far worse economic conditions due to Israeli 
occupation in the West Bank and Gaza are presumably observing the large Israeli 
protests and contemplating their own moves. Of course, one concern for peaceful 
protest is whether 
a government indiscriminately kills nonviolent civilians in significant numbers. For 
example, in August 2011, after many months of Syrian military actions against civilian 
protesters, Saudi Arabia, followed by Bahrain and Kuwait, withdrew their ambassadors, 
while King Abdullah requested that the Syrian "killing machine" be stopped.5 
Thus, the Kingdombs leadership has been observing developments in Israel as a test 
of social mediabs effectiveness in organizing nonviolent protest to create significant 
shifts in security and economic policy. 
Since Palestinian welfare and fair treatment are among Saudi Arabiabs vital interests, 
there are two social media questions that matter to the national security interests of both 
Israel and Saudi Arabia: 
Will orthodox Jews, Israeli Palestinians, and Palestinians in the occupied territories 
seize the historic opportunity to organize together via social media to create meaningful 
nonviolent protests against 
Israelbs pro-settler funding policies that are a root cause of economic deprivation for 
Israelbs majority of civilians living outside of settlements and those living inside the 
occupied territories? 
Would Israel be motivated to change its policies as a result of widespread Palestinian 
social mediaborganized protests against economic deprivation of Palestinians in Israel 
and the occupied territories? 
In any case, such protests have not been limited to Israel and the Arab world. In early 
August 2011, more reverberations from riots in Tunisia and Egypt appeared across 
London and other locations in the United 
Kingdom, turning several areas into "quasiwar zones." These events were organized by 
social media including Twitter and Facebook, as well as BlackBerry Messenger6 The 
police called the unrest the worst in memory, and the streets of London were flooded
