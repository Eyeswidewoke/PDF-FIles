Changes and Uncertainty in U.S. and International Regulation. The Partnership may be 
adversely affected by uncertainties such as international and domestic political developments, 
changes in government policies, taxation, restrictions on foreign investment and currency 
repatriation, currency fluctuations and other developments in the laws and regulations of the 
countries to which the Partnership is exposed through its investments or investor base. The tax 
and regulatory environment for hedge funds is evolving, and changes in the regulation or tax 
treatment of hedge funds and their investments may adversely affect the value of investments 
held by the Partnership or the Partnership's ability to pursue its trading strategy. During this 
period of uncertainty, market participants may react quickly to unconfirmed reports or 
information and as a result there may be increased market volatility. This unpredictability could 
cause the Investment Manager to alter investment and trading plans, including the holding period 
of positions and the nature of instruments used to achieve the Partnership's trading objective. 
In the United States, the Partnership, the Investment Manager and the General Partner 
may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the 
SEC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, and other U.S. governmental regulatory 
authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. In addition, the 
securities and futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes and regulations, including 
margin requirements. Regulators and self-regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized 
to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies. The Dodd-Frank Act could 
result in the Partnership, the Investment Manager and the General Partner becoming subject to 
additional regulatory compliance burdens and trade reporting, which may add significant costs to 
the Partnership. The Dodd-Frank Act endows the SEC, CFTC, and other regulators with 
discretionary authority to write and interpret new rules. The ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank 
Act on the Partnership, the Investment Manager and the General Partner is unclear. 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. 
ASC 740, "Income Taxes" (in part 
formerly known as "FIN 48"), which is part of U.S. GAAP, provides guidance on the recognition 
of uncertain tax positions. ASC 740 may require an entity reporting in accordance with U.S. 
GAAP to reserve a liability for income taxes on its books. ASC 740 prescribes the minimum 
recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an 
entity's financial statements. 
It also provides guidance on recognition, measurement, 
classification and interest and penalties with respect to tax positions. A prospective investor 
should be aware that, among other things, ASC 740 could have a material adverse effect on the 
periodic calculations of the net asset value of the Partnership, including reducing the net asset 
value of the Partnership to reflect reserves for income taxes that may be payable in respect of 
current and/or prior periods by the Partnership. This could cause benefits or detriments to certain 
Limited Partners, depending upon the timing of their entry and exit from the Partnership. 
Also, the recent withdrawal of credit from financial markets has made it more difficult 
for private investment funds to access sources of leverage. To the extent that the Bailout Bill 
does not help eliminate the credit crunch, the Master Fund may be unable to access sources of 
leverage. 
No Separate Legal Counsel. Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolff, & Cohen P.C. ("KKWC") acts 
as legal counsel to the Partnership, the General Partner, the Investment Manager and their 
affiliates. The Partnership does not have legal counsel separate and independent from legal
