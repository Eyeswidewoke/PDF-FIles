For these reasons, we deeply appreciate your contemplation ol' the appropriateness of the 
§ 2255 portion of the Agreement. As we discussed during the December 14 meeting. and es 
expressed in our December 11 letter. it is improper for Mr. Epstein to he required to pay 
recovery to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a claim under § 2255. Some of the 
individuals identified do not consider themselves victims, nor would they be considered victims 
under any meaning of the law, given the evidence. Furthermore. § 2255 allows for a civil 
remedy and there is no basis for the government to be involved with the recovery of damages 
based on civil claims of private individuals. 
While we appreciate your Office's objective to provide certain individuals with 
restitution in connection with this matter. we strongly urge you to consider an appropriate 
process by which such restitution can made. We respectfully reiterate that this process, should 
not include any further federal interference in any way with respect to the recovery of civil 
claims. 
IV, 
Conclusion.
We believe — and know you sham our belief 
that citizens should he treated alike 
regardless of wealth or status when it comes to criminal justice. We ask for nothing mom of 
•your treatment of Mr. Epstein than that he he treated as would any other citizen of Palm Beach 
under similar circumstances. Mr. Epstein should not he charged with offenses to which his 
conduct does not apply. in either the state or federal context. Equal treatment would require that 
Mr. Epstein's prosecution be carried out by the State Attorney's Ollie°. Mr. Epstein's conduct 
does not appropriately lb within the hartland of federal law. Further, we respectfully submit 
that the lateral government should not sit as an -appellate court" and permit an unhappy state 
investigator (in this case one who we contend had little fidelity to the law) to seek review of a 
• decision made in good faith regarding the charging decisions of an elected stale prosecutor. 
As we have expressed to you both at our meeting and in this letter. Florida law mandates 
that the procurement of a minor for the purposes of solicitation requires that the defendant 
procured the individual for activity with a third party. Mr. Epstein's alleged conduct does not lit 
this offense. The routine and practice of Florida state authorities and courts is to distinguish 
between solicitation and procurement of minors. the former being a misdemeanor under state 
law. the latter a felony (and the commission of multiple misdemeanors dues not create a felony). 
hqual treatment would mandate that Mr. Epstein be charged for solicitation and thus, not be 
required to register as a sexual offender. It is improper for the federal government to direct a 
citizen to seek un enhancement of charges that the state prosecutor has deemed appropriately lit 
the conduct and that prosecutors conclusions are consistent with practices regarding other 
citizens of his county for similar offenses. We believe that you should authorize the State 
Attorney for Palm Beach County to decide — based on all the evidence, which we agree you 
should provide him if you agree that he should make the charging decision — whether to require
