14. The paragraphs that were added on page 78 of the 
Booklet as paragraphs 12 through 14 under the section 
captioned "Special Risks of Index Options" by the 
December 2009 Supplement are replaced by the 
following: 
12. Strategies involving the purchase and sale of 
options on a variability index. strategy-based index or 
relative performance index are Inherenjy  complex and 
require a thorough understanding of the concepts that are 
measured by these indexes. Investors must understand the 
method used to caladate the index in order to understand 
how conditions in the market for the component securities 
used to calculate its value may affect the value of the index. 
Investors may fail to realize their Investment objective even if 
they have correctly predicted certain events if they do not 
understand how those events may or may not affect the level 
of the Index. The component secunties of an implied 
volatility index are put and call options (not stocks, which are 
the component securities of stock Indexes). A realized 
variability index, on the other hand, measures the actual 
volatility of an index and is calculated directly from the values 
of the reference index. There is no assurance that predicted 
volatility as measured by a particular implied volatility index 
will correspond to the actual volatility of the reference 
interest or to measures of predicted volatility calculated 
using other methods. A strategy-based index may be 
calculated from the prices of multiple component securities 
of different types, such as in the case of a buy-wnte index 
measuring the return of a strategy that involves transactions 
In stocks and options. The return from a particular strategy 
as measured by a strategy-based index may differ from the 
actual returns that an investor following that strategy 
achieves, because of assumptions regarding transactions 
and the failure to take into account significant factors such 
as 
taxes 
and 
transaction 
costs. Different 
relative 
performance indexes may measure relative performance in 
different ways. Investors should contact the listing options 
market for information on the method of calculation of a 
particular variability index, strategy-based index or relative 
performance index. 
13. Persons 
who 
exercise 
variability options 
strategy-based index options or relative performance 
options or are assigned exercises based on an enoneou% 
index level will ordinarily be required to make settlement
based on the exercise settlement value as initially reported 
by the designated reporting authority toi die index. even if a 
corrected 
value 
is 
subsequently 
announced. 
In 
extraordinary circumstances (e.g., where an exercise 
settlement value as initially reported is obviously wrong, and 
a corrected value is promptly announced), OCC has 
discretion to direct that exercise settlements be based on a 
corrected exercise settlement value. Ordinarily, however, the 
exercise settlement value as initially reported by the 
designated reporting authority for the underlying variability 
index will be conclusive for exercise settlement purposes. As 
described in paragraph 8. on page 77 with respect to other 
indexes, reported levels of a variability index, strategy-based 
index or relative performance index may be based on
