Think All Car Insurance Rates Are the Same? They're Not! 
Maybe last year your car insurance premium went up. But this year 
perhaps it didn't go up as much--or at all. No increase...so no point 
shopping around...all insurance companies' rates are the same 
anyway. The American Express Property Casualty companies could 
still save you money. In fact, we beat our competitors prices 55% of 
the time.*
