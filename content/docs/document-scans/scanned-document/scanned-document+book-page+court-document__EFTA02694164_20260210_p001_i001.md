The Gothic Vision 
Blueprints for technology in patterns of design. 
David Gelernter 
February 2, 2009, Vol. 14, No. 19 
We see better when we recognize and can name (at least for our own purposes) the things we see. If you can tell a 
delphinium from a daylily, or a Titian from a Rubens, or a Honda Civic from a Lotus Elise, you see the world in 
sharper focus than someone who can't. 
Gothic architecture--which emerged near Paris in the 1140s, became a powerful artistic force in most of Europe and 
remained so through the early 1500s—has been studied seriously since the 19th century. No other style of art in 
Western history has had such an intensely magnetic (sometimes passionate, sometimes hypnotic) appeal. You 
might imagine that every aspect of Gothic worth recognizing has already been recognized. Not true. Ideas from 
computer science sharpen our focus on Gothic architecture. They help us identify a fundamental design gesture that 
historians have seen in particular cases, but haven't described as the widespread, general phenomenon it 
is--because they lack the intellectual or ideational vocabulary. 
Software has already played a role in research and writing on medieval architecture. The eminent Alain Erlande-
Brandenburg's recent book on the cathedral of Reims (2007) is part of the new '
rend temoins de ('architecture" 
series. Each book is based on a fabulously detailed software model, which allows one to study the building of 
interest from unexpected viewpoints. Of course, the practice of architecture has been in the hands of the 
computer-aided design industry for years: historical essays illustrated by sophisticated computer-generated images 
are common. Yet the best such images approach nowhere within miles of the detail, precision, and beauty of 
engravings from the studios of such 19th-century master medievalists as Augustus Pugin, Robert Billings, and 
Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. 
Allow me to discuss technology as a source not of tools but ideas. Computer science is useful in this case because 
software happens to resemble Gothic architecture in an unexpected way—"recursive structure" is important to each. 
A structure is said to be recursive if the shape of the whole recurs in the shape of the parts. Imagine a circle, for 
example, formed of welded links that are circles themselves. Each circular link could itself be made of smaller 
circles, and in principle you might have an unbounded nest of circles made of circles made of circles. This sort of 
structure is surprisingly important in software, and in Gothic architecture. 
The idea of recursive structure didn't originate with modern computing, but came into its own there. It first appeared 
as a powerful tool for organizing digital information in a software application designed in the late 1950s by H.L. 
Gelemter, in the course of his pioneering work on artificial intelligence. This application inspired a related one called 
Lisp, where recursive structure is the basic organizing principle not only for data but for the program itself. Years 
later the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot developed his highly influential work on fractal curves as descriptions of 
nature based, partly, on the idea of recursive structure. 
In architecture, the idea occurs in a much simpler way.
