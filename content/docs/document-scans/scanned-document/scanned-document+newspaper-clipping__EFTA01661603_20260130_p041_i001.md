whose identity they could not be allowed to 
know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the mon-
ey came from him. and Towers's financial 
statements for that year show a loan to Ep-
stein of 5400.000. (Epstein has said he 
can't remember the details and has dis-
puted the accuracy of the Towers financial 
reports.) 
Around the same time, Nederlander and 
Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a 
scheme to make money out of Pennwalt, a 
Pennsylvania chemical company,. The plan 
was to group together with two other parties 
to take a substantial declared position in the 
stock. According to a source. Epstein was 
supposed to help Nederlander and Toboroff 
raise 515 million. He seemed to fail to find 
other investors, say those familiar with the 
deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an in-
vestor.) He invested SI million, which he 
told his co-investors was his own money. 
But in his 1989 deposi-
tion he said that he put 
in only 5300.000 of his 
own money. Where did 
the rest come from? Elcif-
fenberg has said it came 
from him, in a loan that 
Nederlander and Toboroff 
didn't know about. 
Two things happened 
that alarmed Nederlander 
and Toboroff. After the 
group signaled a possible 
takeover. the Pennwalt 
management threatened to 
sue the would-be raiders. 
Epstein was reluctant ini-
tially to give a deposition 
about his share of the 
money. telling Toboroff 
there were "reasons" he 
didn't want to. Then. after the opportunity 
for new investors was closed. co-investors 
recall Epstein announcing that he'd found 
one at last: Dick Sityde then C.E.O. of 
the publisher Simon & Scauster. who want-
ed to put up approximately $500,000. (Nei-
ther Epstein nor Snyder can now recall 
the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition 
Epstein said that he had recruited Sny-
der. whom he had met socially. into the 
deal.) 
According to a source. ToborotT and Ne-
derlander told Epstein that Snyder was too 
late. but. without their realizing it. Hoffen. 
has claimed. Snyder wrote a check to 
Hotknberg and bought out some of his in-
vestment. But then Snyder wanted out. 
"Nederlander started to get these irate 
calls from [Snyder] who wasn't part of the 
deal, saying he was owed all this money" 
says someone close to the deal. Toboroff 
a. .. Nederlander were baffled. 
J
ust as Nederlander and Toboroff were 
growing wary of Epstein. he became in-
creasingly involved with Leslie Wexner, whom 
he had met through insurance executive 
Robert Meister and his late wife. Epstein has 
told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in 
Palm Beach, and that he won his confidence 
by persuading him not to invest in the stock 
market. just as the 1987 crash was approach-
ing. His story has subsequently changed. 
When asked if Wexner knew about his con-
nection to Hoffenberg. Epstein said that he 
began working for Wexner in 1989, and that 
"it was certainly not the same time.-
Wherever and whenever it was that Ep-
stein and Wexner actually met, there was 
an immediate and strong personal chem-
istry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is "very 
smart with a combination of excellent judg-
ment and unusually high standards. Also. 
he is always a most loyal friend." 
OFFICE SPACE 
The "office in Epstein's house. It has no 
computers. but it does have a desk that 
Epstein tells people once belonged to banker 
J. P. Morgan. and "the Largest Persian rug 
you'll ever see in a pmate home." 
Sources say Epstein proved that he could 
be useful to Wexner as well. with "fresh" 
ideas about investments. "Weimer had a cou-
ple of bad investments, and Jeffrey cleaned 
those up right away." says a former associ-
ate of Epstein's. 
Before he signed on with Wexner. Epstein 
had several meetings with Harold Levin, then 
head of Wexner Investments. in which he 
enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin 
!bond incomprehensible. "In fact." says some-
one who used to work very closely with Vkx-
ner. "almost everyone at the Limited won-
dered who Epstein was: he literally came 
out of nowhere." 
"Everyone was mystified as to what his 
M
uch of Epstein's work is related to clean-
ing up, tightening budgets. and efficien-
cies. One person who worked for Abner and 
who saw a contract drawn up between the 
two men says Epstein is involved in "every-
thing, not just a little here. a little there. 
Everything!" In addition, he says. "Wexner 
likes having a hatchet man. . .. Whenever 
there is dirty work to be done he'd stick Jef-
frey on it... . He has a reputation for being 
ruthless but he gets the job done." 
Epstein has evidently been asked to fire
personal-staff members when needed. "He 
was that mysterious person that everyone was 
scared to death of." says a former employee. 
Meanwhile. he is also less than popular 
with some people outside Wexner's company 
with whom he now deals. "He 'inserted' 
himself into the construction process of Les-
lie Wexner's yacht.... That resulted in liti-
gation down the road between Mr. Wexner 
and the shipyard that 
eventually built the ves-
sel." says Lars Forsberg. 
a law: :r whose firm at 
the lire. Dickerson and 
R. y. ....as hired to deal 
with litigation stemming 
from the construction 
of Wexner's Limitless—
at 315 feet. one of the 
largest private yachts in 
the wodd. Evidently.. Ep-
stein stalled on paying 
Diekers.'n and Reily for 
its t‘c-k "It's probably 
once r mice in my le-
gal career that I've had 
to sue a client for pitmen 
of services that he'd re-
quested and we'd per-
formed .. . without issue 
on the performance." says Forsberg. In 
the end the matter was settled, but Ep-
stein claims he now has no recollection 
of it. 
The ineklent is Ott of a number of disputes 
Epstein itas become embroiled in. Some are 
for sums so tiny as to be baffling: for instance. 
Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert 
Glass. who sold him the Palm Beach house in 
1990. for S13:444—Epstein claimed this was 
owed him for furnishings removed by Glass. 
In 1998 the U.S. Attorney's Office sued 
Epstein for illegally subletting :he former 
home of the deputy consul general of Iran 
to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Frac!"
