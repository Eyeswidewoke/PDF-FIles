► Stocked in Theater Gunsmoke, this piece reflects a surface of 
misty greys—making it a perfect canvas for endless style and 
decorating options. 
► The stocked Theater Gunsmoke fabric is a woven blend of 
polyester and acrylic, known for its durability and comfort. 
► Choose from 5 additional Theater fabric colors, as well as 14 
additional fabric selections for the same price as stock. 
► Our Landsbury 3 Piece Sectional is also available in more than 
500 designer-inspired fabrics, for a slight increase in price. 
finish 
► Slightly tapered block feet are crafted from solid wood in a 
flannel finish, or you may choose from 15 other shades to 
complement your existing wood pieces. 
► To perfectly accommodate any size living space, our Landsbury 
collection is available in 30 additional pieces by special order. 
construction 
► Built from kiln-dried, cross-directional hardwood laminate for 
lasting strength and stability so it will not change shape due to 
changes in temperature or humidity. 
► Strong, durable and earth friendly, the frame is constructed 
entirely from wood that has been certified by the Sustainable 
Forest Initiative, an organization that maintains the standard in 
the preservation and protection of natural forests. 
► All joints are corner blocked and glued, then doubly reinforced 
with mortise and tenon construction to guarantee years of 
structural reliability. Mortise and tenon assembly is one of the 
best ways to secure two pieces of wood that connects at a "t." 
The end of one piece is fashioned into a round or rectangular 
shape (tenon), which is designed to fit into the same size hole 
on the other end (mortise). 
LANDSBURY 
► Cushions are sustained by a steel suspension system secured 
with heavy-duty, 11-gauge helical coil springs that are made of 
95 percent recycled steel and aluminum. 
► The seat cushions feature a 2.0 density foam core topped with 
an eco-friendly foam wrap consisting of more than 20 percent 
plant-based material and are encased in layers of soft Dacron 
plus an abundance of fibers, feathers and down to deliver an 
irresistibly soft and cozy feel. 
► The entire insert is enfolded in sumptuous down/fiber blend 
that is channel stitched into a down-proof ticking to create that 
irresistible "sink into" feel while maintaining the cushion's 
shape through years of use. 
recommended care 
► Theatre Cleaning Code: S. 
► Spot clean the fabric with a solvent-based cleaning product. 
► For overall cleaning, consult a professional upholstery cleaner. 
► Buff legs occasionally with Guardsman's Furniture Polish. 
► Do not over-wet. 
► All fabric may fade over time. Wearability of fabric is relative to 
care and use. 
► We also recommend flipping the seat cushions periodically and 
avoiding direct exposure to sunlight. 
► Rotate cushions periodically to distribute wear.
