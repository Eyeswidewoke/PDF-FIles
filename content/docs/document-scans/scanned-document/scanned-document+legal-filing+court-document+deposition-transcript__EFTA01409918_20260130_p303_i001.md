Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law 
We have opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL. However, our amended and 
restated certificate of incorporation contains similar provisions 
providing that we may not engage in certain "business combinations" with any 
"interested stockholder" for a three-year period following the time 
that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless: 
• prior to such time, our board of directors approved either the business 
combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder 
becoming an interested stockholder; 
• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder 
becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder 
owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the 
transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or 
• at or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by our 
board of directors and by the affirmative vote of holders of at 
least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the 
interested stockholder. 
Generally, a "business combination" includes a merger, asset or stock sale 
or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested 
stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an "interested stockholder" is a 
person who, together with that person's affiliates and associates, owns, 
or within the previous three years owned, 15% or more of our voting stock. 
Under certain circumstances, this provision will make it more difficult for 
a person who would be an "interested stockholder" to effect various 
business combinations with a corporation for a three-year period. This 
provision may encourage companies interested in acquiring our company to 
negotiate in advance with our board of directors because the stockholder 
approval requirement would be avoided if our board of directors approves 
either the business combination or the transaction which results in the 
stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. These provisions also may 
have the effect of preventing changes in our board of directors and may make 
it more difficult to accomplish transactions which stockholders may 
otherwise deem to be in their best interests. 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the 
Sponsors, their respective affiliates and associates, and any of their 
respective direct or indirect transferees of at least 5% of our outstanding 
common stock and any group as to which such persons are party to, do not 
constitute "interested stockholders" for purposes of this provision. 
Exclusive Forum 
Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that unless we consent to the 
selection of an alternative forum, a state or federal court located 
within the state of Delaware will, with certain limited exceptions, be the 
sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial 
owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our 
behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed 
by 
any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, 
(iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the 
DGCL, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs
