is a victim until it is too late. It may begin with simple affection such as a pat, hug, 
or kiss on the cheek. Sexual activity can begin with conversation about sex. The 
activity can progress to fondling while wrestling, playing hide-and-seek in the 
dark, playing strip poker, swimming nude in the pool, drying the child with a 
towel, massaging an injury, giving a back rub, tickling, playing a physical game, 
or cuddling in bed. The introduction of photography or video cameras during 
this process is common. Innocent pictures progress to pictures of the "fun and 
games" or playing movie star/model that then progress to pictures of the nude or 
partially nude child that then escalate into more sexually explicit pictures. 
Adult pornography is frequently left out for the children to "discover." A 
collection of adult pornography is effective in sexually arousing and lowering the 
inhibitions of adolescent boys. This is the primary reason why preferential child 
molesters collect adult pornography. Some of them may even attempt to use this 
collection as proof that they do not have a sexual preference for children. Alcohol 
and drugs are also used, especially with adolescent boys, to lower inhibitions. By 
the time the victims realize what is going on, they are in the middle of it and 
ashamed of their complicity. They did not "say no, yell, and tell." Much of this 
process can even take place online with a computer without even meeting in 
person. 
Most preferential child molesters usually woik toward a situation in which ' 
the child has to change clothing, spend the night, or both. If the child molester 
achieves either of these two objectives, the success of the seduction is almost 
assured. The objective of changing clothes can be accomplished by such ploys as 
squirting with the garden hose, turning up the heat in the house, exercising, tak-
ing a bath or shower, physical examination of the child, or swimming in a pool. 
Spending the night with the child is the best way for the sexual activity to progress 
Some victims come to realize that the offender has a greater need for this sex 
than they do, and this gives them great leverage against the offender. The victims 
can use sex to manipulate the offender or temporarily withhold sex until they get 
things they want. A few victims even blackmail the offender especially if he is 
married or a pillar of the community. Although all of this is unpleasant and incon-
sistent with our idealistic views about children, when adults and children have 
"consensual" sex the adult is always, the offender, and the child is always the 
victim. Consent is an issue only for adults. 
Operation of Cases Involving Multiple Child Victims 
The ongoing sexual victimization of multiple children is dynamic and ever changing. 
It is like a pipeline. At any given moment there are victims being recruited, 
seduced, molested, and let go or "dumped." For most acquaintance offenders it is 
easy to recruit, seduce, and molest the victims, but it is difficult to let the victims 
go without their turning against the offender and disclosing the abuse. 
The offenders control the victims once they are in the pipeline through a com-
bination of bonding, competition, and peer pressure. Most children, especially 
adolescent children, want to be a part of some peer group. Any offender operat-
ing a sex ring has to find a way to bind the victims together. Some offenders use 
an existing structure such as a scout troop, sports team, or school dub. Other 
offenders create their own group such as a magic dub,. computer dub, or reli-
gious group. Some offenders just make up a name and establish their own rules
