PLEXIGLAS MIRROR INSTALLATION 
AND ATTACHMENT RECOMMENDATIONS 
(For ceiling installation and attachment 
recommendations see page 9.) 
ADHESIVE ATTACHMENT 
Double-laced Foam Tape. 
Double-faced loam tape may be used for most 
Plexiglas mirror mounting requirements. The tape 
is simple to use and provides the cleanest method 
of attachment. The tape may be used for small 
fabricated items to adhere Plexiglas mirror to itself 
or Plexiglas mirror to another material. Double-
faced foam tapes provide the flattest mounting and 
thus, the best image reproduction in Plexiglas mir-
ror installations. To obtain optimum flatness of the 
mirror, the foam tape should be cut into panel 
length pieces. The pieces should be distributed 
evenly over the back of the mirror. The surface to 
which the mirror is to be placed should be flat, 
smooth, clean and should not have significant sur-
face irregularities such as that found on a stuccoed 
surface. The tape should be no less than 1/4 " from 
edges of Plexiglas mirror. 
The following table lists recommended foam tape 
sizes to be used with specific sizes of Plexiglas 
mirror and recommended placement of the tape 
for optimum flatness.

Silicone Sealants 
Plexiglas mirror may be installed on many types of 
surfaces or attached to itself using silicone seal-
ants as adhesives. Silicone sealants should be 
used in place of mastics or panel adhesives. Panel 
adhesives tend to destroy the reflective coat. Sili-
cone sealants will remain flexible for long periods 
of time and are readily available from building sup-
ply centers and Authorized Plexiglas Distributors 
in either small tubes or caulking gun sizes. When 
using silicone sealants as adhesives, they should 
be applied to the Plexiglas mirror in evenly dis-
persed, open end beads; this will allow the adhe-
sive to cure properly. The Plexiglas mirror may 
have to be supported or secured with tape for 24 
hours until the sealant cures. Use only pigmented 
silicone sealants on Plexiglas mirror; clear silicone 
sealants will cause failure of the mirror appearance.

Contact Cements 
Contact cements can be used for installing 
Plexiglas mirror on many types of surfaces. They 
are useful when fast drying or setting of the bond 
is necessary. Contact cements do require the ap-
plication of the adhesive to both the Plexiglas 
mirror and the surface to which it is being attached. 
Apply the cement with a fine brush, enamel paint 
roller, or spray it on in order to apply it evenly. Wait 
until the cement dries sufficiently so that a piece of 
paper will not stick to it before placing the Plexiglas 
mirror into position. This allows the solvents in the 
cement to evaporate. Applying the Plexiglas mir-
ror before the cement is dry will result in failure 
in the mirror appearance. Since the mirror cannot 
be moved after placement, a slip sheet of kraft 
paper should be used between the two cemented 
surfaces to position the mirror properly. Because 
of thermal and humidity expansion of Plexiglas 
mirror, the size of a Plexiglas mirror panel is lim-
ited to the following recommendations. The chart 
provides the maximum allowable long dimension 
with temperature change of area of use of Plexiglas 
mirror when installed with contact cements.
