If you're looking to buy a home or to refinance your mortgage, American Express 
Mortgages" can save you hundreds of dollars a month in mortgage payments. 
With mortgage rates near all-time lows, the time to purchase or refinance is now.

*A customer must provide a complete, system-generated Good Faith Estimate, 
listing a specific lenders name, that is dated the same day as the rate quoted by 
us. If such Good Faith Estimate indicates a lower interest rate than our rate, 
inclusive of points and loan fees for the same loan program that is offered by us 
and we have verified the accuracy of the rate and fees listed, then we will have 
the option of beating that lender's total loan costs by $100, or paying the 
customer $500 ($750 for properties located in California) when they close with 
that lender and then provide us with a copy of the signed Note and Final HUD-1 
Settlement Statement.
