After fridays discussion 
https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/pic-archive/aircraft-ownership/bus=ness-justification-aircraft-expenses 
I suggest you focus on large issues first. . the discussions re personal=use of plane . parties travel. may be relevant at 
the tippy tip of the =argins but these answers should flow from the structure. On what for= will you use the 
deduction. ? which business. , its structure. differ=nt buisnesses etc. 
Barry , what you will find is that there is very few answers to be found=on point as people in leons position rarely make 
cases to tax court. ex=eption being estate issues. . planes owned by farmers salesman, bank=rs. are usually small 
planes. meaningless to leons issue. large bi= gets are usually owned by corporations. . the facts. there are app=ox 
400,000 planes in the states. out of that large number only about 13,=000 total private jets. out of that class only 
2000 large jets and=most owned by corporations. how many people have business of leons size= . not including his 
art work. 
You asked , me what do we do now. as I told Brad years ago. Fir=t and foremost is accurate numbers presented 
in an organized fashion. =that is 80 percent of the grunt work. Once all the numbers are in shape = ie materials for 
the building of the financial architecture. . Leons =goals must be addressed and programatic . this takes hours of 
discussi.n. . next . plans are drawn up, . modifications are made, issues of=sec regulation, tax, control, succession. 
mechanics. all need to be plan=ed and adjusted to meet the goals. 
You need to recognize that there are few , very few examples of the h=use that in leons case needs to be re built. 
most people with leons we=lth have a serious family office with a huge stock portfolio. , not art.= and of those , few 
hold dormant assets ie apollo.. Its been ten yea=s since apollo went public. and the house needs total renovation. 
up=rades in tech, security, and the family has changed all very similar t= architecting a house after the children have 
grown and left.
