If the Company violates any such laws and regulations that are applicable to it, the 
Company could be subjected to liability, including (1) criminal penalties (such as imprisonment 
and fines), (2) civil penalties (including monetary penalties and the loss of any licenses or 
approvals the Company may require for its business) and (3) exclusion, suspension or material 
restriction from participation in governmental healthcare programs (such as Medicare and 
Medicaid). 
The Company intends to conduct its business in compliance with applicable regulatory 
requirements. 
However, the healthcare industry is highly regulated by complex statutory 
provisions, many of which have not been specifically interpreted by the courts or through detailed 
governmental regulations. While the Company will attempt to conduct its business in conformity 
with federal and state law, governmental agencies could challenge some of its business practices 
under these laws. If the Company's business practices are challenged, the Company may not be 
able to successfully change the way it operates. Any of these events could cause the Company's 
revenue to decline. 
Physician Members are likewise required to comply with an extensive regulatory scheme. 
Compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect the licensing of a Member 
Physician and profitability of his or her practice, which in turn could preclude such Member 
Physician from providing products and services to patients referred by the Company or decline to 
renew or extend his or her membership in the group of physician to which the Company refers 
prospective patients. 
A decrease in the popularity or acceptability of laser assisted lipoysis and similar 
procedures or services intended to be marketed by the Company would likely have a 
material and adverse affect on the Company. 
Laser assisted lipoysis and similar medical treatments have received increased criticism in 
the media over the last several years. If, as a consequence of such criticism, an increase in 
acceptance of alternative medical procedures or other factors, the advisability or popularity of 
laser assisted lipoysis and similar medical treatments decreases, there will likely be less need or 
demand for the referral services intended to be provided by the Company. And any decrease in 
the advisability or popularity of laser assisted lipoysis and similar medical treatments will likely 
have an adverse affect on the prospects for the Company and its business. 
The Company's ability to attract potential patients to be referred to Member Physician is 
likely to be affected by the willingness of insurance companies and government programs to 
pay for, or to reimburse patients for, the medical treatments provided. 
A potential patient's willingness to contact the Company for a referral and to engage a 
Member Physician to provide laser assisted lipoysis or other medical treatment is likely to be 
affected by the cost of such medical treatment and, perhaps more importantly, the amount of such 
cost such potential patient will be required to personally bear. Accordingly, to the extent insurers 
fails to provide medical coverage for laser assisted lipoysis or other medical treatments marketed 
by the Company or Medicare, Medicaid and other government payment arrangements decline to 
provide reimbursement for laser assisted lipoysis or such other medical treatments, it should be 
anticipated that there will be less need for the services proposed to be offered by the Company.
