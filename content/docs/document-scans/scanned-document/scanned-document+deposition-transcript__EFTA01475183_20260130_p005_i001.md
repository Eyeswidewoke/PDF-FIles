real value of exchange rates over long periods, i.e., deviations are long 
lived but cyclical and mean reverting. But EM FX by contrast is massively 
structurally (always) cheap on a PPP basis, given their earlier stage of 
economic development. EM real exchange rates will likely converge to PPP 
only with the convergence of per capita incomes, i.e., in the very very long 
run. So the cheapness of EM FX on a PPP basis is not cyclical but 
structural (How Much Will Fast Growing EM Currencies Appreciate, Sep 
2005). 
IIThe $35 trillion myth. Using PPP exchange rates raises the size and weight 
of EM in the global economy massively. To get some idea of how much, 
consider some of the bigger emerging markets exchange rates versus their 
PPP levels. For China, a market CNY of 6.4 versus the dollar compares with 
a PPP rate of 3.6. So measuring Chinese GDP at PPP exchange rates raises 
it 1.8 times. For India, a market INR of 66.5 compares with a PPP rate of 
18, which is 3.7 times higher. For EM as a whole, nominal GDP of $30 
trillion at current market exchange rates compares with $65 trillion at PPP 
rates, i.e., a more than doubling. This is $35 trillion of EM and global GDP 
which does not and has never existed. To put it in perspective another way, 
the size of the overstatement is about two US GDPs. 
Global growth has been rising when measured using market rate based 
weights 
Using rolling market exchange rate based weights global GDP growth has 
historically been lower than the IMF's headline measure based on PPP rates, 
averaging 2.9% versus 3.5% at PPP weights. Global growth bottomed with the 
European financial crisis in 2012 at 2.4% then rose to 2.7% by 2014, still 
somewhat below trend or average rates. 
The arithmetic of EM and global growth: 
IIDM still bigger than EM. At PPP rates, EM accounts for 57% and DM 43% 
of global GDP. This differential is the source of current perceptions that EM 
is more important for the global economy than DM. At market exchange 
rate weights on the other hand, EM accounts for a smaller 40% and DM 
for 60%. Some other arithmetic facts of note: the US and Eurozone 
together (24%+16%) equal the size of all of EM (40%) in the global 
economy, while the US is 1.5 times the size of China (24%:16%); 
IIlpp of DM growth equals 1.5pp of EM growth. The weights at market 
exchange rates (60:40) imply that 1pp of additional DM growth offsets a 
1.5pp slowing in EM. The arithmetic of the US vs China (24:16) is similar in 
that 1pp of additional US growth offsets 1.5pp of slowing in China. 
Where is global growth going? What about commodities? Earnings? 
IIContinued normalization of EM growth but almost there, while DM growth 
picks up. We have long argued that the large multi-year outperformance of 
EM during 2001-2010 represented the confluence of a variety of 
circumstantial factors. That each of the factors had gone into reverse, but 
had not run its course (When Will EM Stop Derating, Sep 2013). EM 
growth in 2015 is expected to have reverted further back into its historical
