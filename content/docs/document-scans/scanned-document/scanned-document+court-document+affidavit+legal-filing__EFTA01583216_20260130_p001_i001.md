12. I am aware that exercise assignment notices for option contracts are allocated among customer short positions pursuant to an 
automated procedure that randomly selects from among all customer short positions, including positions established on the 
day of assignment and those contracts that are subject to assignment. All American-style short option positions are liable for 
assignment at•any time. By contrast, the writer of a European-style option is subject to assignment on expiration. A more 
detailed description of the carrying broker's random allocation procedure Ls available upon request. 
B. Special Statement for Uncovered Options Writers 
There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing that expose the investor to potentially significant losses. Therefore, 
this type of strategy may not be suitable for all clients approved for options transactions. The potential loss of uncovered all option 
writing is unlimited. The writer of an uncovered call Is In an extremely risky position, and must understand that he/she may Incur 
large losses W the value of the underlying Instrument Increases above the exercise price. As with writing uncovered calls, the risk of 
writing uncovered put options is substantial. The writer of an uncovered put option bears a risk of loss If the value of the underlying 
Instrument declines below the exercise price. Such loss could be substantial if there is a significant dedine in the value of the 
underlying Instrument.
