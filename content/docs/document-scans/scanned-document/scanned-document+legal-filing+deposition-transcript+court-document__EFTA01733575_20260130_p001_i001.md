A statement by Jeffrey Epstein's lawyers 
With the latest flurry of tabloid reports that continue to perpetuate the wildly 
inaccurate, exaggerated and, indeed, fabricated statements regarding Mr. Epstein, we 
believe a statement about the actual events and circumstances involving Mr. Epstein is 
now required to set the record straight. 
First, President Clinton has never, not a single time ever, even stepped foot on 
Mr. Epstein's island in the Caribbean. Any description of dinners, people in attendance 
and their places at the dinner table on Mr. Epstein's island are all part of the same 
imagined fairy tale, which has been paid for handsomely by irresponsible journalists 
and repeated all too eagerly by the media. 
Second, Mr. Epstein has never even met Vice President Al Gore and his wife, 
Tipper, so they too could never have been on Mr. Epstein's island, although this too 
has been falsely reported in the media with skillful embellishment about what a lovely 
couple the two seemed to be. 
Third, Mr. Trump's representatives have confirmed repeatedly that Mr. Trump 
has never engaged in any sexual conduct of any kind in Mr. Epstein's presence, 
although we understand why the media would wish to perpetuate such a sensational 
tale at the height of the presidential election. 
Fourth, Mr. Epstein's criminal conviction, a matter of public record readily 
available to even a novice reporter, has been carelessly and inaccurately 
sensationalized in the media. In fact, he was convicted of two offenses, one count of 
solicitation of prostitution without reference to the age of any female, and a second 
count of procuring a single person under the age of 18 for prostitution. For these 
offenses, Mr. Epstein received a 30-month sentence, consisting of 18 months of 
incarceration and 12 months of closely supervised and very restricted probation. While 
he served that sentence, he was not housed by himself in a private or special wing of 
the jail, as has been widely and inaccurately reported. He was housed in one of many 
cells located in a particular wing of the jail where other inmates were also housed at the 
same time. Like Mr. Epstein, each of those inmates was restricted from contact with 
the others, but all were housed at the same time in the same area of the jail. 
Mr. Epstein served 13 months of that 18-month sentence in jail, receiving the 
same "gain" time that would be received by each and every person, whether rich or 
poor, who serves time in jail for similar offenses and behaves properly during 
incarceration. 
His release was not a matter of any special treatment, but the 
administration of regular policy applicable to all who are jailed in Palm Beach County. 
As part of the same universally applied policy applicable to all persons incarcerated in 
Palm Beach County Jail, Mr. Epstein qualified for and was granted restricted and 
monitored work release on the same terms as would be available to any similarly 
situated inmate. 
He received no special treatment or politically or economically 
motivated favoritism. 
In order to provide necessary balance to the outrageously exaggerated tabloid 
reports, we have wanted to provide detail about the prior backgrounds of some of the 
young women that came to Mr. Epstein's home to give him erotic massages in 
exchange for money, including work in prostitution, at massage parlors and as exotic
