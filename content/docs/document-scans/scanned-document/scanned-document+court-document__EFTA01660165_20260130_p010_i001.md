To the extent that §2422(b) criminalizes the use of the Internet (or telephone) by a 
sexual predator to target a vulnerable minor and to convince, or to try to convince, her to 
engage in conduct proscribed by law, the statute may not be unconstitutional on its face. 
See United States v. 1)karsky, 446 F.3d 458, 470 (3d Cir. 2006) (both §§ 2422(b) and 
2423(b) "fall squarely within Congress's power to regulate the first two categories of 
activities described in Lopez"), The statute would, however, be plainly unconstitutional if 
it were applied to situations like Mr. Epstein's, where neither the telephone nor the 
intemet was used in that fashion, and where the use of the telephone was, at most, a 
tenuous link in a chain of events that may, or may not, have preceded or followed sexual 
contact with a minor.9 In other words, if the instrumentality of commerce is not the 
vehicle used to facilitate the harm Congress is trying to address, but is simply a 
"jurisdictional hook," the hook is too weakly connected to the problem (sexual crimes 
against minors) to sustain the statute as a proper exercise of Commerce Clause power. 
Questions about the nature of federalism, and, specifically, just how far the 
federal government may go into matters of traditionally state concern, will continue to 
arise and will be answered case-by-case. As Justice O'Connor said in her dissent in 
Gonzales v. Balch, 545 U.S. 1, 47 (2005), ". . . the task is to identify a mode of analysis 
that allows Congress to regulate more than nothing ... and less than everything..." 
(O'Connor, J. dissenting). United States v. Ballinger, 395 F.3d 1218 (11th Cir. 2005), 
illustrates the difficulty of the task. In that case, the deeply split en Banc Court 
considered whether and to what extent the Commerce Clause authority included the 
power to punish a church arsonist who had traveled in interstate commerce to commit his 
arsons. 
Though clearly not settled, what is clear is that Congress's specification of a 
jurisdictional element such as the use of an instrumentality or channel of interstate 
9 As can be readily noted on the chart at Tab "B", to the extent discernable, every case brought 
under §2422(b) in this district includes use of the intemet. There are only four reported cases in 
the Eleventh Circuit involving use of the phones only: three of them concern telephone calls to 
travel agencies advertising overseas underage sex tours and involved explicit talk of sexual 
activity with known minors. A fourth is United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176 (11th Cir. 2007) 
(11th Cir, 2007). But there, in facts far different from those presented here, the defendant 
"admitted using both a cellular telephone and a land-line telephone to entice Jane Doe to engage 
in Prostitution" (emphasis added). That admission makes Evans no precedent for a prosecution 
here, since there is no evidence the phones were used "to entice".
