2. 
Non-Disclosure and Non-Use of Confidential Information. The Confidential 
Information is provided for the sole purpose of each party's evaluation of the other party 
and its respective affiliates (the "Business Purpose"). A Recipient shall not copy, 
reproduce, disclose, publish or disseminate any Confidential Information to anyone 
other than to its affiliates, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, and/or legal and 
financial advisors (under a duty of confidentiality no less restrictive than the terms 
hereof 
whether 
by 
pre-existing 
agreement 
or 
relationship) 
(collectively, 
"Representatives") who need access to Confidential Information for the Business 
Purpose, and a Recipient shall use at least the same degree of care used to protect the 
unauthorized use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of its own Confidential 
Information, but in any case no less than a reasonable degree of care. No Recipient 
shall, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, disclose to any third 
party (other than its Representatives) the fact that the Confidential Information exists or 
has been made available, the Business Purpose, that the parties are considering any 
potential transaction in connection with the Business Purpose or otherwise, or that 
discussions or negotiations are taking or have taken place concerning the Business 
Purpose or any other potential transaction between the parties, or any term, condition 
or other facts relating to the Business Purpose or any other potential transaction or 
such discussions or negotiations, including, without limitation, the status thereof or the 
subject matter of this Agreement. Each party hereby agrees and acknowledges that it 
will be responsible for a breach of this Agreement by it and its Representatives to 
whom it has provided Confidential Information. Each party accepts the Confidential 
Information solely for the Business Purpose and in connection with the discussions 
hereunder. If a Recipient receives notice that it may be or is required or ordered by any 
judicial, governmental, or other judicial or regulatory entity to disclose this Agreement 
and/or any Confidential Information, such Recipient shall, to the extent permissible by 
law, (a) give the Disclosing Party notice as promptly as practicable in order for the 
Disclosing Party to contest such requirement or order, (b) at the Disclosing Party's sole 
expense, reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party in seeking a protective order 
or other remedy to limit the disclosure of such Confidential Information to the extent 
required under this Agreement and (c) to the extent that this Agreement and/or any 
Confidential Information is required to be disclosed, submit a request, at the Disclosing 
Party's sole expense, that this Agreement and/or any other Confidential Information be 
held in confidence to the fullest extent permitted under the laws, rules or regulations of 
any other applicable governing body of the body or tribunal to which disclosure is being 
made. A Recipient shall notify a Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any 
unauthorized disclosure, use or loss of Confidential Information or any breach of this 
Agreement by such Recipient and shall reasonably cooperate as requested by such 
Disclosing Party to recover and prohibit any further unauthorized disclosure, use or 
loss of Confidential Information. 
3. 
No Warranty. 
ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS," 
AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, 
IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES 
REGARDING 
ITS 
ACCURACY, 
COMPLETENESS, 
PERFORMANCE 
OR 
NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR ITS MERCHANTABILITY OR 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
