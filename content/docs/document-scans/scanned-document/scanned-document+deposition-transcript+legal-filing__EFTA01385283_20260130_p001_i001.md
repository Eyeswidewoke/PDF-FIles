Potential Risks to U.S. Residential Construction 
Potential MID reductions, elimination of SALT deduction, changes to capital 
gain treatment, and overall affordability issues 
At the time of writing, the Republican-led Congress appears likely on the verge 
of passing a tax reform package which may change (unfavorably) MID (on 
primary and secondary homes basis and for home equity loans), lengthen the 
time necessary to hold primary real estate to be exempted from capital gains 
taxes, and eliminate the majority SALT deductions (limited to $10k). 
The 
National Association of Realtors (NARI notes on their website that through its 
research, the reduction in MID to a lower loan figure ($750k appears to be the 
compromised figure) from the current Slmn in addition to the overall increase 
in standard deductions and elimination SALT deductions could ultimately lead 
to a "12% decline in property prices". 
The NAR appears to draw this 
conclusion from the fact that a materially higher standard deduction 
(contemplated under the tax reform) may eliminate an individual's ability/need 
to itemize and therefore eliminate the economic incentive of a home purchase. 
NAR notes that of the people who claimed MID in 2013, 55% earned less than 
$100,000 and 88% earned less than 8200,000. 
We look at NAR's full 
argument with some reservations but do agree there are likely "unintended 
consequences" to changing long-standing dynamics in the housing market. 
These are also likely to manifest themselves more in higher-cost states like NY, 
CA, MA, CO, CT, and FL to name a few. However, as shown in the graphic 
below (Figure 14), less than 13% of the new home sold in October 2017 were 
priced above $500k. Therefore, it seems unlikely to us that changes MID 
would have such a widespread, systemic impact as concluded by NAR. 
Turning to changes in capital gains, the current tax regime requires that a 
homeowner own and use their primary residence for two of the previous five 
years prior to a sale which will allow the homeowner to avoid taxation on the 
capital gains up to certain limits. However, under both the Senate and House 
versions of the tax reform package, this figure is increased to five years out of 
the previous eight. This is likely to impact the velocity of existing home sales, 
decrease mobility of homeowners and generally slow the housing market. 
Finally, with home prices (as shown in Figure 5) now rising nationally 6% 
above their prior peak general affordability has declined y/y (Figure 15). 
According to the NAR, its Housing Affordability Index measures "whether or 
not a typical family earns enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a 
typical home at the national and regional levels based on the most recent price 
and income data". As shown below, the Affordability Index has declined to 
148.9 in 3Q17 from 163.7% (-9%) y/y. Using the NAR's methodology this has 
been driven by not only a 7% rise in the median existing single-family home 
price, but also an almost 40bp increase in the mortgage rate. Although the 
interest rate rise that many predicted in the beginning of 2017 (and discussed 
in our 2017 Outlook) never materialized in the amount expected, 2018 is again 
expected to be another year where the 10Y Treasury yield (a general 
benchmark on which 30Y mortgage rates are set ) is expected to average 
2.87% by 4Q18 according to Bloomberg, auguring for a likely similar reaction 
in 30Y mortgage rates.
