However, The Hill (11/14, Axelrod, 2.98M) reports Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) "said 
progressives' calls to 'defund the police' were in part to blame for Democratic losses in the 
House in a cycle when the party was expected to gain seats." While on WAMU's "Politics Hour," 
Warner on Friday said, "I think the ability, using terms like 'defund the police' have led to 
Democratic losses in this last year." 
WPost Analysis: How Biden Approaches Police Violence "Could Provide Some 
Answers To Concerns" Black Voters Have Regarding Democratic Party. In another 
Washington Post (11/14, 14.2M) analysis, Eugene Scott says, "Because the Democratic Party 
didn't benefit from the blue wave that many expected on Election Day, some lawmakers and 
party leaders are suggesting Democrats need to distance themselves from the messaging and, 
perhaps, ideas surrounding one of the most popular issues with the party's base. That could 
mean disappointing one of the groups that can take credit for Joe Biden's victory: Black voters." 
A Post-Ipsos poll from June shows that "Black voters considered racism and policing to be 
among their top issues heading into the election." The Post adds that a large number of 
Americans want Biden "to approach concerns about police violence differently than Trump. How 
his administration responds could provide some answers to concerns of Black voters that the 
Democratic Party is always ready to take their votes but not fully address their issues." 
Even With New Police Law, Critics Feel Baltimore County Has A Great Deal More To 
Do. 
The Washington Post (11/14, 14.2M) says Baltimore County in October approved a policing law 
that, among other things, "compels officers to intervene if they witness excessive use of force." 
Moreover, the bill is meant "to curtail the use of chokeholds by county officers, allowing that use 
of force only in defense against death or serious bodily injury." Critics, however, "say that while 
the legislation and other recent changes have some merit, the county has much more to do." 
NAACP Baltimore County Branch President Tony Fugett said, "The proof is in the pudding," 
adding, "You've checked all the boxes. Now the work has to begin, and are you really in earnest 
going to do the work?" Fugett "said the NAACP has been 'screaming at the top of our lungs' 
about the police department's issues internally and with traffic stop disparities, but he is glad 
the county is finally taking steps to address it." 
NYTimes Al: Some Staff Members At New York City Police Watchdog Claim Recent 
Layoffs At Agency Were Due To Retaliation. 
On its front page, the New York Times (11/12, Al, Southall, 18.61M) reported, "Four senior 
officials at the New York City agency that examines allegations of police misconduct were laid 
off abruptly on Thursday in what officials described as a restructuring meant to expand its 
investigative muscle." However, a number of staff members at "the agency, the Civilian 
Complaint Review Board, said the layoffs were retaliation for the officials' roles in criticizing how 
the board responds when the Police Department refuses to cooperate with its investigations." 
The Times adds, "The layoffs came after several high-profile police killings of Black people, 
including George Floyd in Minneapolis, touched off huge protests against police brutality across 
the United States and led to a surge of complaints against officers in New York and other cites." 
Minneapolis Sees Surging Violence As Droves Of Officers Leave Police Department. 
The Washington Post (11/12, Bailey, 14.2M) reports that about half a year after George Floyd's 
death in Minneapolis precipitated enormous "protests and left a wide swath of the city burned 
and destroyed, Minneapolis is grappling with dueling crises: an unprecedented wave of violence 
and droves of officer departures that the Minneapolis Police Department warns could soon leave 
the force unable to respond to emergencies." According to the Post, "Homicides in Minneapolis 
are up 50 percent, with nearly 75 people killed across the city so far this year. More than 500 
people have been shot, the highest number in more than a decade and twice as many as in
