between Houthi fighters, tribes aligned with the Ahmar clan and the Sunni Isiah party, and 
government security forces. In the past two weeks, clashes—particularly around the area of Amran, 
northwest of the capital Sanaa—have resulted in more than 30 deaths. A ceasefire brokered by a 
presidential committee on May 25" lasted only two days before fighting reignited. However, a recent 
threat made by President Hadi to label the Houthi movement a terrorist organization if its members 
do not renounce violence may have stemmed some of the bloodshed, since this could provide 
evidence for the preventive capabilities of the current UN sanctions regime against spoilers of the 
transitional process in Yemen. 
Meanwhile, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has stepped up its retaliatory efforts following a U.S.-
backed offensive by security forces in the southern province of Hadramawt. An attack on a 
government institution in Seiyan resulted in at least 27 deaths. 
Libya: The security situation continues to deteriorate in Libya, with continuous gunfire and clashes in 
Benghazi and an increase in kidnappings, assassinations, fighting, crime, and general lawlessness 
throughout the country. Fuelling this insecurity is the uncertainty regarding the rightful holder of the 
position of prime minister and the rise of anti-Islamist General Hiftar and his self-proclaimed 
"national Libyan army" in the east, both of which play into the growing divide between Islamist, non-
Islamist, and regional leaders. While the General National Congress (GNC) confirmed Islamist-backed 
Ahmed Matiq as prime minister for the moment, the decision remains contested within the GNC and 
recent attacks on his compound further illustrate the violent polarization gripping the country and its 
political institutions. Matiq is Libya's fifth prime minister since the fall of Qaddafi in 2011. Meanwhile, 
General Hiftar, who has refused to recognize Matiq and who many Libyans fear is primarily concerned 
with his own personal gain, has nonetheless won support from various militia, tribal, and political 
leaders as a counterweight to Libya's more extremist and conservative militias. Parliamentary 
elections remain scheduled for June 25th. 
Morocco: Labor demonstrations and student unrest have returned to the streets of Morocco and its 
campuses recently, in parallel with the government's move to end subsidies in place since the Arab 
Spring in 2011. Months-long negotiations between three Moroccan labor unions and the Ministry of 
Employment over unemployment, working conditions, wages, and living standards seem to have 
reached an impasse. Social activists have joined the labor demonstrations and 11 members of the anti-
regime, pro-democracy 20 February movement were arrested following their involvement in a labor 
union march on April e. Furthermore, animosity between certain Islamist and secularist student 
groups recently escalated and resulted in the death of Abderrahim Hasnaoui, a student leader of 
Attajdid Tollabi, a group close to the ruling Islamist Justice and Development Party. The government 
has since vowed to end violence on university campuses, arresting suspects in the death of Hasnaoui 
and altering protocol to allow security forces to intervene earlier on campuses, risking government 
over-reach. 
Iran/GCC: While a PS + 1-Iranian nuclear deal continues to simmer, new signs of a détente between 
Iran and Arab Gulf countries continue to appear. Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah 
arrived in Tehran on June 1" for a landmark two•day visit, which aimed to close the rift between Iran 
and its Sunni-ruled neighbors in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). This was the Kuwaiti emir's first 
visit to Tehran as head of state. His delegation included ministers of oil, finance, industry, and foreign 
affairs. The latter minister, Khaled al-Jarallah, took this opportunity to discuss the situation in Syria 
and potential rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, according to press reports. Meanwhile, 
Saudi foreign minister Prince Saud al-Faisal has invited his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif
