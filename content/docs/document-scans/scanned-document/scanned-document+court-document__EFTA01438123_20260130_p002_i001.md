action of Receiving Party; or (iv) is approved by Disclosing Party in 
writing for release prior to such release. "Affiliate" shall mean any 
corporation, company, or other entity, which: (i) is Controlled by a party 
hereto; or (ii) Controls a party hereto; or (iii) is under common Control

by the controlling entity. Confidential Information so received hereunder by 
an Affiliate of Receiving Party shall be considered as Confidential 
Information received by Receiving Party and be subject to the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement. 
3. 
Non-Use and Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. 
All Confidential Information shall at all times remain the property of 
Disclosing Party. Receiving Party agrees not to use any Confidential 
Information disclosed to it by Disclosing Party for its own use or for any 
purpose except to carry out the specific purposes designated by Disclosing

Party agrees that it will take all reasonable measures to protect the 
secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information of 
Disclosing Party in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain 
or the possession of unauthorized persons, which measures shall consist of 
the degree of care that Receiving Party utilizes to protect its own 
confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a 
reasonable level of care. Receiving Party agrees to, immediately after its 
knowledge thereof, notify Disclosing Party in writing of any misuse or 
misappropriation of such Confidential Information of Disclosing Party, which 
may come to its attention.
