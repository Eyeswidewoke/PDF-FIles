under any federal or state securities laws, and such Notes are being issued 
and sold in reliance upon exemptions from registration provided by such 
laws. The Notes will be subject to certain transfer restrictions and will 
only be transferable to certain permitted transferees to be identified in 
the Transaction documentation. Furthermore, the Issuer will restrict 
ownership of any interests in the Subordinated Notes so that no assets of 
the Issuer will be deemed to be "plan assets" subject to ERISA and/or 
Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code. An investor may not be able to 
find a buyer for the Notes or any other product should it wish to sell such 
product. If a buyer can be found, the price offered by that buyer may be 
lower than the price that an investor paid for the product or the amount an 
investor would otherwise receive on the maturity of the product. 
In 
addition, small holdings may not be transferable, and where a Note has a 
minimum specified denomination or settlement amount, an investor will not be 
able to transfer the Note unless it increases its holding to at least that 
minimum denomination or settlement amount. An investor in the Notes must be 
prepared to hold for an indefinite period of time or until maturity or 
redemption. 
Regulatory Changes. In response to the downturn in the credit markets and 
the global economic crisis, various agencies and regulatory bodies of the 
U.S. federal government have taken or are considering taking actions to 
address the financial crisis. These actions include, but are not limited 
to, the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act ("Dodd Frank Act"), which was signed into law on July 21, 
2010, and which imposes a new regulatory framework over the U.S. financial 
services industry and the consumer credit markets in general, and proposed 
regulations by the SEC that, if enacted, would significantly alter the 
manner in which asset-backed securities, including securities similar to the 
Notes, are issued and structured and increase the reporting obligations of 
the issuers of such securities. On August 28, 2013, joint regulators in the 
United States re-proposed credit risk retention rules under Section 941 of 
Dodd-Frank. These re-proposed rules have not yet gone into effect and are 
subject to comment and further modification by the joint regulators. 
Given 
the broad scope and sweeping nature of the changes and the fact that final 
implementing rules and regulations have not yet been enacted, the potential 
impact of these actions on the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, any of the 
Notes, any owners of interests in the Notes or the CLO market generally is 
unknown, and no assurance can be made that the impact of such changes would 
not have a material adverse effect on the prospects of the Issuer or the 
value or marketability of the Notes. In particular, if existing 
transactions are not exempted from any such new rules or regulations, the 
costs of compliance with such rules and regulations could have a material 
adverse effect on the Issuer and the owners of Notes. 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Commodity Exchange Act to 
include "swaps" in the definition of "commodity interests" which, if traded 
by an entity may cause that entity to fall within the definition of a 
"commodity pool" under the Commodity Exchange Act and the Collateral Manager 
to fall within the definition of a "commodity pool operator". Based on 
recent CFTC interpretive guidance, the Issuer is not expected to be treated
