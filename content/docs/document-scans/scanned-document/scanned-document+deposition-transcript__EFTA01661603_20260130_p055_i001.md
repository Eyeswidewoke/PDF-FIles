Abstract (Document Summary) 
JASON Mewes is alive and well. Mewes, who played the long- haired, drug-loving "Jay" in Kevin Smith's 
"Clerks," "Mall Rats," "Chasing Amy" and "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back," was reportedly on the lam or even 
feared dead after his friends told the Chicago Sun-Times they hadn't seen him in 10 months. An arrest warrant 
had been issued for him after he violated probation on a heroin conviction. But last month, Mewes made an 
appearance at a film festival in Malibu to promote his new indie movie "RSVP," and he'll host a talent show Oct. 
17 at Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va. "The rumors of his death are greatly exaggerated," chuckled 
Mewes' agent, Nancy Oeswein. "I just got off the phone with him. He's certainly not in hiding. He just moved to 
L.A." For some folks, living on the Left Coast is as good as being dead. 
IS Sen. John'McCain going to quit the Republican Party and become the running mate of Sen. John Kerry in the 
2004 presidential race? McCaip's chief political adviser, John Weaver, has become a Democrat and is now 
working for Dick•Gephardt. McCain's new legislative director, Christine Dodd, last worked for a liberal 
congressman - a Democrat. Now Kerry of Massachusetts, who has made clear his plans to run in 2004, is 
making overtures towards McCain. A rumored head- to-head between Kerry and McCain is said to be scheduled 
at McCain's cabin in Sedona, Ariz., next month. And for "Man of the People," the new McCain biography by Paul 
Alexander, Kerry provided a blurb that reads more like a love letter. After noting that McCain's 2000 presidential 
campaign "set the standard for honor, dignity, courage, and truth," Kerry declares: "I have had no greater 
privilege in all my life than finding and then standing on common groundwith John McCain, and I look forward to 
fighting side by side with him on yet another day to make our country stronger."

CALL it "The Three Amigos' Most Excellent African Adventure." 
Former President Bill Clinton is on a trip through Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Mozambique and South Africa with 
Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, the star of "Rush Hour" and its sequel. 
The three are being flown around Africa on the private plane of financial wizard Jeffrey Epstein. The secretive 
Epstein handles the billions of Leslie Wexner, head of the retail empire that includes The Limited, Victoria's 
Secret and Express. 
How Clinton, who took off on Saturday, hooked up with his traveling companions is a mystery - as is his 
relationship to Epstein. Little is known about Epstein except that his offices are in the landmarked Villard House 
across from Le Cirque, and he once employed Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British press lord Robert 
Maxwell, in an unspecified capacity. 
But Tucker is playing America's first black president in "Mr. President," a movie he's been working on since 
1999. Tucker has already shot footage of Clinton, Nelson Mandela, and Bahrain's crown prince endorsing his 
candidacy, and the comic accompanied U2 frontman Bono and Treasury Secrtary Paul O'Neill on their debt-
relief tour of Africa this summer. 
At the Congressional Black Caucus' annual awards dinner earlier this month, Clinton mentioned that Tucker had 
asked to visit him in the Oval Office to prepare for playing the first black president. 
"I didn't have the heart to tell him that I've already taken the position," Clinton joked. In an October 1998 essay in 
The New Yorker, author Toni Morrison argued that Clinton, "white skin notwithstanding, (is] our first black 
president." 
Kevin Spacey has no presidential aspirations we know of. Last we heard, he wanted to portray Bobby Darin. He 
might be bored during some parts of the trip.
