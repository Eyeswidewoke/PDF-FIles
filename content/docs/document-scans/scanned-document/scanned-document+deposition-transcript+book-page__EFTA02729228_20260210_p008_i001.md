Despite the circumstances of Epstein's 
leaving. Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his 
annual bonus—which he anticipated as he-
ins appravimately 5100.000. 
The S.E.C. never brought any charges 
against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider 
trading in St. Joe. but its questioning seems 
to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein's 
answers. Some sources have wondered 
why. if he was such a big producer at Bear 
Stearns. he would haw given it up over a 
mete 53.500 fine. 
Certainly the years after Epstein left the 
firm were not obviously prosperous ones. 
His luck didn't seem to change until he met 
Hoffenberg. 
O
ne of Epstein's first assignments for Hof-
titers was to mastermind doomed bids 
to take over Pan American World Airways in 
1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. 
Hofknberg claimed in a 1993 hearing before 
a grand jury m Illinois that Epstein came up 
with the idea of financing these bids through 
Tower's acquisition of two ailing Illinois 
insurance companies. Associated Life and 
United Fire -He was hired by as to work on 
the securities side of the insurance companies 
and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a 
profit fa us and for the companies." Hoffen-
berg reportedly told the grand jury. He also 
alleged that Epstein wis the "technician." m-

ecuting the schemes, although, having no 
broker's license, he had to rely on others to 
make the trades. Much of Hoffcnberg's sub-
sequent testimony in his criminal case has 
proven to be false. and Epstein has claimed 
he was merely asked how the bids could be 
accomplished and has said he had nothing 
to do with the financing of them. Yet Rich 
and Allen. the former treasurer of United 
Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three 
times at the company. lie and another ex-
ecutive say they had direct dealing with Ep-
stein over the finances. And in his deposition 
of 1989. Epstein stated that he was the one 
who executed "all" Hoffmberls instructions 
to buy and sell the stock. He called it "mak-
ing the orders." He could not recall whether 
he had chosen the brokers used. 
To win approval from the Illinois insur-
ance regulators for Totters's acquisition of 
the companies. Hoffenberg promised to in-
feet 53 million of new capital into them. In 
fact. in his grand-jury testimony Holknberg 
claimed that he. his chief operating officer. 
Mitchell Bata. and Epstein came up with a 
scheme to steal S3 million of the insurance 
companies bonds to buy Pan Am and Em-
ery stock. "Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Butter 
arranged the various brokerage acaaunts for 
the bonds to be placed with in New York. 
and 1 think one in Chicago. Rodman St Ren-
shaw." Hoffenberg reportedly said. Then. 
said Hoffenberg, while making it appear as 
though they were investing the bonds in 
much safer financial instruments. they used 
them as collateral to buy the stock. "Ep-
stein .as the person in chance of the trans-
actions. and Mitchell Bruer teas assisting 
him with it in coordination on behalf of the 
insurance companies money." Hotknberg 
claimed at the time. 
At one point, according to Hoffenberg. a 
broker forged the documents necessary fix a 
51.8 million check to be written on insurance' 
company funds. The check %vas used to buy 
more stock in the takeover targets. Mean-
while. in order to throw the insurance regula-
tors ott the 51.8 million was rammed u being 
safely invested in a money-market account. 
United Fire's former chief financial officer 
Daniel Payton confirms pan of HotTenbag's 
account. He says he recalls making one or 
two telephone calls to Epstein (at Holten. 
berg's direction) about the missing bonds. 
"He said. 'Oh. yeah. they still exist.' But we 
found out later that he had sold those assets 
... leveraged them ... land] used some mar-
gin account to take some positions in ... 
Emery and Pan Am.- says Payton. 
Epstein's extraordinary creativity was. ac-
cording to Hoffenberg. responsible for the 
purchase by the insurance companies of a 
$500.000 bond. with no money down. "Ep-
stein created a great scheme to purchase a 
5500.000 treasury bond that would not be 
shown ... (as1 wgiikthor collateralized. 
E
pstein was involved with Wallenberg in 
other questionable transactions. Finan-
cial records show that in 1988 Epstein in-
vested .51.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc.. a 
company that manufactures football hehnets. 
Among his co-investors were the theater 
mogul Robert Nederlander and attorney 
Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this 
transaction claims that Epstein told Neder-
lander and Toboroff that he had raised his

ll 
he reportedly told the grand jury. "It looked 
like it was free and clear but it actually 
wasn't" he said. 
Epstein has denied he ever had any deal-
ings with anyone from the insurance com-
panies. But Richard Allen says he recalls 
talking to Epstein at Hoffenbag's direction 
and telling him it was urgent they retrieve 
the missing bonds for a state examination. 
According to Allen Epstein said, "We'U get 
them back." He had "kind of a flippant atti-
tude." says Allen. "They never came back." 
E
pstein. according to Hoffenberg. also 
came up with a scheme to manipulate 
the price of Emery Freight stock in an at-
tempt to minimize the losses that occurred 
when HotTenberg's bid went wrong and the 
share price began to fall. This was alleged to 
lite involved multiple clic& accounts con-
trolled by Epstein. 
EVentUally. in 1991 insurance regulators in
Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case. 
and Epstein. who was only a paid consul-
tant. was never deposed or accused of arty 
wrongdoing. Barry Gross. the attorney who 
was handling the suit for the regulators. says 
of Epstein. "He was very elusive.... It was 
hard to really track hint down. There were a 
substantial number of checks for significant 
dollars that were paid to him. I remem-
ber.... He was this character we never got a 
handle on. Again we presumed that Ix was 
involved with the Pan Am and Emery run 
that Hoffenberg made. but we never got a 
chance to depose him.-
"From the government's discovery in the 
main sentencing against Hoffenbag a ssculd 
seem the gosemment was perhaps a bit lazy? 
mys David Lewis. who represented Mitchell 
Beata. "They went for what they knew they 
could get ... and that was the trauduient 
promissory notes (i.e., the much larger and 
unrelated part of Hoffenberg's fraud. based 
in New York State].... What they couldn't 
get. they didn't bother with." 
Another lawyer involved in the criminal 
prosecution of Hoffenberg says. "In a crim-
inal investigation like that. when there is 
guilty plea. to be quick and dirty about it. 
discovery is always incomplete.... They 
don't have to line up witnesses: they don't 
have to learn every fact that might come out 
on cross-examination."
