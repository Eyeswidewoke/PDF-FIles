Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Sales of restricted shares under Rule 144 in the United States are also 
subject to requirements regarding the manner of sale, notice, and the 
availability of current public information about us. Rule 144 also provides 
that, following a six-month holding period, affiliates may sell shares of 
our common stock that are not restricted shares in the United States, 
provided that they comply with the same restrictions applicable to restricted 
shares. 
Rule 701 
In general, and subject to expiration of the applicable lock-up 
restrictions, any of our employees, non-employee directors or officers who 
purchased shares from us in connection with a qualified compensatory stock 
or option plan or other written agreement before the effective date of 
this offering, or who purchased shares from us after that date upon the 
exercise of options granted before that date (subject to the lock-up 
agreements referred to below, as applicable), which qualify under Rule 701 
promulgated under the Securities Act, are eligible to resell such shares 
in reliance upon Rule 144 beginning 90 days after the date of this 
prospectus. If such person is not an affiliate, the sale may be made under 
Rule 
144 without compliance with the holding periods of Rule 144 and subject only 
to the manner-of-sale restrictions of Rule 144. If such a person is an 
affiliate, the sale may be made under Rule 144 without compliance with its 
one-year minimum holding period, but subject to the other Rule 144 
restrictions. 
As of the date of this prospectus, options to purchase a total of 2,197,382 
shares of our common stock were outstanding, excluding 138,200 
shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options we 
expect to grant to employees upon the closing of this offering at an 
exercise price equal to the initial public offering price. 
Form S-8 Registration Statements 
We intend to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the 
Securities Act upon consummation of this offering to register for 
the purposes of United States federal securities laws the shares of our 
common stock that are issuable pursuant to our 2012 Plan and our 2015 Plan. 
These registration statements are expected to be filed and become effective 
as soon as practicable after the effective date of this offering. Shares 
covered by these registration statements will then be eligible for sale in 
the public markets in the United States, subject to the lock-up agreements 
and, if applicable, to Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates. 
Registration Rights 
After this offering, and subject to the lock-up agreements, the THL Funds, 
which will hold approximately 82% (or 80% if the underwriters' 
option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full) of our common 
stock after completion of this offering, will be entitled to certain rights 
with respect to the registration of their shares of our common stock under 
the Securities Act after the completion of this offering. For more 
information, see "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions--
Stockholders Agreement." After such registration, these shares of our 
common stock will become freely tradable without restriction under the 
EFTA01410225
