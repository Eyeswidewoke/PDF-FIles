absence of the self-ordering scalar fields, r, is equal to 
the measured quantity reff, but the present measurement 
currently allows r, to have a considerably lower value if 
self-ordering scalar fields dominate the observed signal. 
A priori, this need not have been the case. Since only 
three of these ratios are independent, but there are now 
constraints on four of them, in principle, the data is capa-
ble of ruling out the existence of self-ordering scalar fields 
as a source. To explicitly determine the constraints we 
express f in terms of reff, x and ry

Fig.1 shows a plot off as a function of x reveals that f 
grows monotonically with x, diverging at x„,, = refry, Pt. 
0.085. This cm I esponds to a situation where the SOSF 
contribution essentially accounts for all of the observed 
BICEP2 polarization, and therefore contributes a frac-
tion 0.2/2.34 of the (isocurvature) power in scalar density 
perturbations. 
Since zoo is less than the maximum iso-curvature ra-
tio compatible with the temperature anisotropy data we 
arrive at the disappointing conclusion that the new mea-
surement of ref does not additionally constraint self-
ordering scalar fields. Had ref been larger, the isocurva-
Lure contribution of SOSF to scalar density perturbations 
would have to have been larger to account for the entire 
tensor signal, and existing constraints on this contribu-
tion would have therefore constrained f, and thereby the 
symmetry breaking scale, Vim. 
While this is disappointing, it is cause for hope. A 
small improvement on the iso-curvature fraction in CMB 
temperature fluctuations would imply that SOSF cannot 
give the full measured contribution to rot and therefore 
the signal from inflation is observable in the data. Alter-
natively a non-zero measured isocurvature fraction might 
be suggestive that an SOSF has occurred and contributes 
to the BICEP2 signal.

Finally for completeness we display the inflationary 
tensor to scalar ratio r1 that may be inferred from the 
data as a function of the isocurvature fraction of scalar 
density perturbations induced by SOSF. This allows a 
quantitative estimate of how future constraints on this 
fraction can then allow one to infer the fraction of the 
BICEP2 signal that must result from Inflation. 
Fig.2 shows a plot of r, as a function of x over its al-
lowed range. As can be seen, if the current upper limit of 
0.09 is reduced by a factor about 2, then the inflationary 
contribution must dominate. However, even a reduction 
by only 20% or so would imply a clear non-zero inflation-
ary component to the observed BICEP2 signal 
NVItile it is perhaps frustrating that the current ob-
servation cannot unambiguously rule out this toy model 
straw man as a source of gravitational waves that could 
polarize the CMB signal as observed by BICEP2. How-
ever, as we have described, we are at the threshold of 
being able to argue that Inflation unambiguously pro-
vides at the very least a non-zero component of the sig-
nal. Note that because the scale of inflation varies as the 
fourth root of r, the scale of inflation will remain essen-
tially identical to the Grand Unified Scale independent 
of whether it contributes all, or only a fraction of the 
observed polarization signal. 
We also note that the current analysis has not in-
cluded the possible contribution from vector modes due 
to SOSF. However since such modes are known to con-
tribute roughly equally to scalar and tensor modes in the 
CMB it should not significantly affect ratios, although 
it would need to be calculated and included in a more 
complete future quantitative analysis. 
Finally we note that while current data cannot defini-
tively rule out a SOSF transition as the source of gravita-
