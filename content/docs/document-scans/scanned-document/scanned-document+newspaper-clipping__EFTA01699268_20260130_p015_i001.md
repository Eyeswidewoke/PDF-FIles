Fonatur opened bidding for engineering work 
on the Mayan Train in May. The tender elicited 
enough questions from interested yet confused par-
ties to fill a 253-page document. The session sched-
uled to respond to those queries had to be delayed 
a month to allow Fonatur enough time to come up 
with answers. "Look, I'm not against the train," 
says Eduardo Ramirez, president of the Mexican 
Chamber of the Construction Industry. "But they 
need to prove this is economically feasible and that 
it won't be a burden for future administrations. We 
can't keep absorbing governments' mistakes—it's 
always the Mexican people who end up paying." 
Fonatur chief Rogelio Jimenez Pons told 
Bloomberg in February that "a group of too of 
Lopez Obrador's closest friends" has funded stud-
ies that contain traffic projections, but his agency 
"can't share them just yet." 
The Mayan Train's current estimates put its 
per-kilometer cost at $5.2 million, on par with 
France's Valence-Marseille route, the sixth-lowest 
among 22 lines worldwide that IMCO studied. "It's 
not clear how they got to that number," Zapata 
says. "But what is clear is that international expe-
rience shows these projects—even when they're 
perfectly planned—tend to end up costing as much 
as 130% more." 
The only other passenger train that's being built 
in Mexico will connect the capital to the nearby 
industrial town of Toluca. Started under former 
President Enrique Pefia Nieto, it's been beset by 
problems, including lacking the right of way in 
some parts. The line was supposed to be up and

running in early 2018, but today there's still no start 
date in sight and costs are running 92% over budget. 
Its price tag has grown to $66 million per kilometer, 
IMCO says, making it the third-most-expensive line 
in its study. "You'd think the Mexican government 
would learn from this, but apparently they're head-
ing in the same direction;' Zapata says. 
Pefia Nieto's administration also studied the idea 
of building a train in the southeast. It would have 
been about five times smaller, but ultimately the 
administration shelved the project when oil prices 
fell and the federal budget took a hit. 
AMLO's government is looking to fund 90% of 
the Mayan Train through a so-called Fibra-a hybrid 
of a master limited partnership and a real estate 
investment trust. This is the same vehicle that was 
I used to fund part of the $13 billion cost of building 
a new airport for Mexico City, a project the presi-
dent canceled late last year, triggering a sell-off in 
Mexican bonds, stocks, and the peso. 
Environmentalists have voiced concerns about 
the impact a project this size will have on the 
region's fragile ecosystem. The proposed route 
is home to an estimated 800 to 1,200 jaguars, an 
already endangered species, according to Panthera, 
a New York-based nonprofit focused on the conser-
vation of wildcats. 
To allow the animals to roam freely, the govern-
ment is considering building large overpasses along 
sections of the track, likely modeled on those built 
in Canada's Banff National Park for grizzly bears, 
beavers, and other big mammals. It's unclear if the 
current budget for the Mayan Train includes money 
for any overpasses; the Canadian structures cost 
as much as $2 million each, according to Mircea 
Hidalgo, a member of Panthera Mexico's scientific 10-
