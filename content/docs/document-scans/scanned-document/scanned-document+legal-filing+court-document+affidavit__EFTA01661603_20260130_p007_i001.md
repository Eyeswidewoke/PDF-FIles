Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa F... Page 7 of 32 
His firm would be different, too. He was not here just to offer investment advice; he saw himself as the 
financial architect of every aspect of his client's wealth -- from investments to philanthropy to tax 
planning to security to assuaging the guilt and burdens that large sums of inherited wealth can bring on. 
"I want people to understand the power, the responsibility, and the burden of their money," he said to a 
colleague at the time. 
As a teacher at Dalton, he had witnessed firsthand the troubled attitudes of some of the poor little rich 
kids under his charge; at Bear, he had come to the realization that, counterintuitively, the more money 
you had, the more anxious you became. For a middle-class kid from Brooklyn, it just didn't make sense. 
From the get-go, his business was successful. But the conditions for investing with Epstein were steep: 
He would take total control of the billion dollars, charge a flat fee, and assume power of attorney to do 
whatever he thought was necessary to advance his client's financial cause. And he remained true to the 
$1 billion entry fee. According to people who know him, if you were worth $700 million and felt the 
need for the services of Epstein and Co., you would receive a not-so-polite no-thank-you from Epstein. 
It's nice work if you can get it. Epstein runs a lean operation, and those close to him say that his actual 
staff— based here in Manhattan at the Villard House (home to Le Cirque); New Albany, Ohio; and St. 
Thomas, where he reincorporated his company seven years ago (now called Financial Trust Co.) —
numbers around 150 and is purely administrative. When it comes to putting these billions to work in the 
markets, it is Epstein himself making all the investment calls — there are no analysts or portfolio 
managers, just twenty accountants to keep the wheels greased and a bevy of assistants -- many of them 
conspicuously attractive young women -- to organize his hectic life. So assuming, conservatively, a fee 
of .5 percent (he takes no commissions or percentages) on $15 billion, that makes for a management fee 
of $75 million a year straight into Jeff Epstein's pocket. Nice work indeed. 
It has been rumored that Linda Wachner and David Rockefeller have been clients, too, but both parties 
deny any such relationship. What's more, who ever heard of a financial adviser turning down $500 
million accounts? All the speculation and mystery has proved fertile ground for some alternative Jeffrey 
Epstein stories — the most bizarre of which has him playing the piano (he is classically trained) for high 
rollers in a Manhattan piano bar in the mid-eighties. 
Another focus of curiosity is the relationship that Epstein has with his patron and mentor Leslie Wexner, 
founder and chairman of the Columbus, Ohio—based Limited chain of women's-clothing stores. Wexner, 
who is said to be worth more than $2.5 billion by Forbes, became an Epstein client in 1987. "It's a weird 
relationship," says another Wall Streeter who knows Epstein. "It's just not typical for someone of such 
enormous wealth to all of a sudden give his money to some guy most people have never heard of." The 
Wexner-Epstein relationship is indeed a multifaceted one. 
Given the secrecy that envelops Epstein's client list, some have speculated that Wexner is the primary 
source of Epstein's lavish life -- but friends leap to his defense. "Let me tell you: Jeffrey Epstein has 
other clients besides Wexner. I know because some of them are my clients," says noted m&a lawyer 
Dennis Block of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. "I sent him a $500 million client a few years ago and 
he wouldn't take him. Said the account was too small. Both the client and I were amazed. But that's 
Jeffrey." 
Epstein' s current residence in Manhattan — a 45,000-square-foot eight-story mansion on East 71st Street 
-- was originally bought by Wexner for $13 million in 1989. Wexner poured many millions into a full 
gut renovation, then turned it over to Epstein in 1995 after he got married. One story has Epstein paying 
only a dollar for it, though others say he paid full market price, which would have been in the
