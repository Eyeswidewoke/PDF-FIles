Prohibited Person, (ii) the funds invested in the Partnership on the New Limited Partner's own behalf 
or, if applicable, on behalf of any of its beneficial owner(s), were not and are not derived from activities 
that may contravene any U.S. or international laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws 
and regulations, and (iii) to the extent the New Limited Partner has any beneficial owners,'' (a) it has 
carried out thorough due diligence to establish the identities of such beneficial owners and has complied 
with all applicable anti-money laundering and similar laws, regulations and orders to which the New 
Limited Partner is subject, (b) based on such due diligence, the New Limited Partner reasonably believes 
that no such beneficial owners are Prohibited Persons, (c) it holds the evidence of such identities and 
status and will maintain all such evidence for at least five years from the date of the New Limited Partners 
complete withdrawal from the Partnership, and (d) it will make available such information and any 
additional information requested by the Partnership that is required under applicable regulations. 
(c) If any of the foregoing representations, warranties or covenants ceases to be true or 
if the Partnership no longer reasonably believes that it has satisfactory evidence as to their truth, 
notwithstanding any other agreement to the contrary, the Partnership may, in accordance with applicable 
regulations, be obligated to freeze the New Limited Partners investment, either by prohibiting additional 
investments, declining or suspending any withdrawal requests and/or segregating the assets constituting 
the investment, or the New Limited Partners investment may immediately be involuntarily withdrawn by 
the Partnership, and the Partnership may also be required to report such action and to disclose the New 
Limited Partners identity to OFAC or other authority. In the event that the Partnership is required to take 
any of the foregoing actions, the New Limited Partner understands and agrees that it shall have no claim 
against the Partnership, the General Partner, the Investment Manager, the Administrator, or their 
respective affiliates, directors, members, partners, shareholders, officers, employees and agents for any 
form of damages as a result of any of the aforementioned actions. 
(d) The New Limited Partner understands and agrees that any withdrawal proceeds paid 
to it will be paid to the same account from which the New Limited Partners investment in the Partnership 
was originally remitted, unless the Administrator, in its sole discretion, agrees otherwise.

General Partner, the Investment Manager, the Administrator and their respective affiliates, directors, 
members, partners, shareholders, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all losses, 
liabilities, damages, penalties, costs, fees and expenses (including legal fees and disbursements) which 
may result, directly or indirectly, from any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, 
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement. 
SEVENTEENTH: If the New Limited Partner is a privately held entity, and the New

then the New Limited Partner must submit a completed copy of the attached Annex D of Appendix G

hereunder will be deemed to be reaffirmed by him or her at any time he or she makes an additional
