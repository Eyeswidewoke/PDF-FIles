9. Paragraph 6 provides that it is the intent to settle all disputes covering the subject matter of the Settlement 
Agreement - why limit this to "coveri=g the subject matter of this Agreement." The releases provided fo= in the 
Settlement Agreement are general releases and paragraph 14 provide= that "it is expressly agreed that the sole and 
exclusive purpose of=20 settlement is to resolve all differences between the parties." =AO There is no limitation there. 
10. Gary's attorney's comment that he wants paragraph 8 to state that it is=20 binding on Peggy too, seems 
unnecessary. Peggy's rights to re=eive distributions and payments from the trusts and the estate are in her individual 
capacity and not in a representative capacity on behalf of another entity. Also, Peggy is signing the agreement and 
paragraph 18=20 already provides that the agreement is binding on her. Moreover, Pegg= is agreeing in paragraph 8(d) 
that Gary's signing of the agreement =n his fiduciary capacity binds her as beneficiary and all successor fiduciaries. 
11. Note in paragraph 9 that Florida law governs the Settlement Agreement and in paragraph 10 that Federal and state 
courts are the exclusive venue for any action brought in connection with the Settlement Agreement.

12. Paragraph 14 requiring full cooperation in the event of a collateral attack by third parties on the Settlement 
Agreement is interesting. Full cooperation may require payment of costs and fees, including attorneys fees. I suspect 
there may be provisions in the will and trusts which=20 indemnify Gary for his attorney fees and costs when acting in his 
fiduciary capacities. To the extent payments of those fees and costs=20 come out of the trusts and the estate, one-half 
of those fees and costs are essentially being borne by Peggy. So in the event of a collateral=20 attack, in addition to 
Peggy having to pay 100% of any costs and fees Peggy must occur to defend against it, it may be possible that Peggy will 
essentially bear one-half of Gary's costs and fees as well. =AO This may be more theoretical than practical as one 
attorney could probably represent both Gary and Peggy in their defense of collateral attacks because their respective 
interests in any such collateral attacks will presumably coincide. But depending on what you are trying to achieve=20 
with your comments, it may be worth noting. 
13. Please note Gary's attorney's comment limiting the a=plicability of attorney's fees awards to disputes where 
distributions described in=the Settlement Agreement are unreasonably withheld. First, this limitatio= seems 
unnecessary where fees are only awarded to the prevailing party to begin with. Second, I am not sure how likely it is 
that Peggy will=20 have to sue Gary for anything other than unreasonable withholding of distributions; nor do I have any 
idea whether it is likely that Gary may try to sue Peggy for something covered by the general release provided for in the 
Settlement Agreement. If either of those events is possibl=, then why should Peggy agree to eliminate her right to fees? 
Also, to=20 the extent that the parties have a reasonable dispute concerning the amount of a distribution that should be 
made to Peggy, the existence of a prevailing party fees provision may make the parties more amenable to resolving that 
difference outside of court. Depending on relative wealth of Peggy and Gary, not sure who has more of a strategic 
advantage to a prevailing party fee provision without the additional limitation proposed by Gary's lawyer.
