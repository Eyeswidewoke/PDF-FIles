unpleasant and inconsistent with our idealistic views about children, when adults and children have 
"consensual" sex the adult is always the offender, and the child is always the victim. Consent should 
be an issue only for adult victims. 
As has been stated, sympathy for victims is inversely proportional to their age and sexual 
development. We often focus on adolescent victims when we want volume and impact, but we do 
little to address the nature of their victimization. We want to view them as innocent children when 
they are sexually victimized, but then try them as fully accountable adults when they commit a 
violent crime. The greatest potential to worsen societal attitudes about child victims who comply 
in their sexual exploitation comes from societal attitudes about child offenders. If increasing 
numbers of ever younger children are held fully accountable for their criminal behavior and tried in 
court as adults, it becomes harder and harder to argue that the "consent" of children of the same ages 
is irrelevant when they engage in sexual activity with adults. 
The reality of compliant child victims is subtly and discreetly dealt with everyday in this 
country by investigators, prosecutors, judges, juries, and others. Some professionals feel that this 
controversy is best dealt with by overtly pretending that it really does not exist. They believe that 
to explicitly admit or discuss it would be harmful to child victims. Many would certainly object to 
the use of a term or label like compliant child victim. I believe, however, that this reality must be 
openly recognized, discussed, and addressed. We cannot continue to hold increasing numbers of 
ever younger juveniles accountable as adults for their criminal behavior and simultaneously argue 
that their consent to engage in sexual behavior does not matter. I have come to believe the best way 
to deal with the problem is to change, not fuel, people's unrealistic expectations about the sexual 
victimization of children. The criminal sexual assault of an adult is, by definition, almost always 
violent. The criminal sexual assault of a child may or may not be violent. Unfortunately, too many 
lay people and even professionals hearing terms such as sexual assault or rape in the sexual 
victimization of children seek out or expect evidence of physical violence. 
In this discussion, I have focused primarily on the problems (i.e., false denials, delayed 
disclosures, incomplete and inaccurate details, etc.) that compliant child victims present for the 
criminal justice system. I believe, however, such victims also present considerable problems and 
challenges for therapists, physicians, social workers, and other professionals. Awareness and 
prevention programs that focus on recognizing evil sexual "predators" and "pedophiles" and on 
advising victims to say "no," yell, and tell are not only ineffective in preventing compliant 
victimization, but they also make the problem worse. Such programs decrease the likelihood of 
victim disclosure and increase the shame and guilt of such victims. In almost every case involving 
compliant child victims that I have evaluated, true victims have had to distort varying aspects of their 
victimization in statements to parents, investigators, therapists, physicians, attorneys, and the court. 
Each subsequent statement often requires increasing deceptions to defend the previous ones. What 
axe the long-term emotional and psychological consequences for child victims who are exposed to 
prevention and awareness programs that seem to deny the reality of their victimization or who must 
distort, misrepresent, and lie about what actually happened to them in order to have it accepted as 
"real" victimization?
