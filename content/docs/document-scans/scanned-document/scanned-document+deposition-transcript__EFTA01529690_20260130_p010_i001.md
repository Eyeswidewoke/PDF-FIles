JEFFREY EPSTEIN ACCT. 
For the Period 6/1/10 to 6/30/10 
close of business of the date of this statement and, except as otherwise 
agreed in writing, these valuations do not represent the actual terms at 
which transactions or securities could be bought or sold or 
new transactions could be entered into, or the actual terms on which 
existing transactions or securities could be liquidated as of the date of 
this statement. We do not warrant their completeness or 
accuracy. These valuations are derived from proprietary models based upon 
well-recognized financial principles and we have, when necessary to 
calculate the present value of future cash flows, made 
reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions. Valuations 
based on other models or different assumptions may yield different results. 
J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility 
for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the 
valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the 
valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. 
Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended 
solely for your own use. Please refer to the trade confirmation for details 
of each transaction. 
Please review your statement promptly and report any discrepancies 
immediately to an account officer whose name appears on the contact page of 
this statement. 
This statement is not an official document for income tax reporting purposes. 
Deposits in Foreign Branches are not insured by the FDIC or any other Agency 
of the Federal Government; Amounts in such foreign accounts do not have the 
benefit of any Domestic 
preference applicable to U.S Banks; certain Foreign accounts are considered 
reportable to the Internal Revenue Service on a Report of Foreign Bank and 
Financial Account (TD F 90-22.1). 
Important Information Regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt 
or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically 
in an auction. Although there may be daily, 
weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be 
liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the 
securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the 
event of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market 
will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price 
reflected on statements and online.Accordingly, investors 
should not rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or 
online with respect to ARS. Where J.P. Morgan was unable to obtain a price 
from an outside service for a particular ARS, the price 
column on your statement and online will indicate "$0.00" which however 
should not be relied on as the price at which ARS would trade. 
You should have received separate confirmations for each securities 
transaction. All transactions are subject to the terms and conditions stated 
on the reverse side of such confirmations and are subject 
to the constitution, by-laws, customs and interpretations of the marketplace 
where executed and governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the State of New York and all applicable 
federal laws and regulations. Further information with respect to
