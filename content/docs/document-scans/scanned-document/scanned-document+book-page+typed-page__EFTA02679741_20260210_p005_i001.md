the level of selection. What is good for 
the individual or culture may have bad 
consequences for the species, as when 
sexual reinforcement leads to overpop-
ulation or the reinforcing amenities of 
civilization to the exhaustion of re-
sources; what is good for the species or 
culture may be bad for the individual, as 
when practices designed to control pro-
creation or preserve resources restrict 
individual freedom; and so on. There is 
nothing inconsistent or contradictory 
about these uses of "good" or "bad," or 
about other value judgments. so long as 
the level of selection is specified. 
An Initiating Agent 
The role of selection by consequences 
has been particularly resisted because 
there is no place for the initiating agent 
suggested by classical mechanics. We 
try to identify such an agent when we say 
(i) that a species adapts to an environ-
ment. rather than that the environment 
selects the adaptive traits; (ii) that an 
individual adjusts to a situation, rather 
than that the situation shapes and main-
tains adjusted behavior; and (iii) that a 
group of people solve a problem raised 
by certain circumstances, rather than 
that the circumstances select the cultural 
practices which yield a solution. 
The question of an initiating agent is 
raised in its most acute form by our own 
place in this history. Darwin and Spen-
cer thought that selection would neces-
sarily lead to perfection, but species, 
people, and cultures all perish when they 
cannot cope with rapid change, and our 
species now appears to be threatened. 
Must we wait for selection to solve the 
problems of overpopulation, exhaustion 
of resources, pollution of the environ-
ment, and a nuclear holocaust, or can we 
take explicit steps to make our future 
more secure? In the latter case, must 
we not in some sense transcend selec-
tion? 
We could be said to intervene in the 
process of selection when as geneticists 
we change the characteristics of a spe-
cies or create new species, or when as 
governors, employers, or teachers we 
change the behavior of persons. or when 
we design new cultural practices; but in 
504 
none of these ways do we escape from 
selection by consequences. In the first 
place, we can work only through varia-
tion and selection. At level i we can 
change genes and chromosomes or con-
tingencies of survival, as in selective 
breeding. At level ii we can introduce 
new forms of behavior—for example, by 
showing or telling people what to do with 
respect to relevant contingencies—or 
construct and maintain new selective 
contingencies. At level iii we can intro-
duce new cultural practices or. rarely, 
arrange special contingencies of surviv-
al—for example, to preserve a traditional 
practice. But having done these things, 
we must wait for selection to occur. 
(There is a special reason why these 
limitations are significant. It is often said 
that the human species is now able to 
control its own genetics, its own behav-
ior, and its own destiny, but it does not 
do so in the sense in which the term 
control is used in classical mechanics. It 
does not for the very reason that living 
things are not machines: selection by 
consequences makes the difference.) In 
the second place, we must consider the 
possibility that our behavior in interven-
ing is itself a product of selection. We 
tend to regard ourselves as initiating 
agents only because we know or remem-
ber so little about our genetic and envi-
ronmental histories. 
Although we can now predict many of 
the contingencies of selection to which 
the human species will probably be ex-
posed at all three levels and can specify 
behavior that will satisfy many of them, 
we have failed to establish cultural prac-
tices under which much of that behavior 
is selected and maintained. It is possible 
that our effort to preserve the role of the 
individual as an originator is at fault, and 
that a wider recognition of the role of 
selection by consequences will make an 
important difference. 
The present scene is not encouraging. 
Psychology is the discipline of choice at 
level ii, hut few psychologists pay much 
attention to selection. The existentialists 
among them are explicitly concerned 
with the here and now, rather than the 
past and future. Structuralists and devel-
opmentalists tend to neglect selective 
contingencies in their search for causal 
principles such as organization or 
growth. The conviction that contingen-
cies are stored as information is only one 
of the reasons why the appeal to cogni-
tive functions is not helpful. The three 
personae of psychoanalytic theory are in 
many respects close to our three levels 
of selection; but the id does not ade-
quately represent the enormous contri-
bution of the natural history of the spe-
cies; the superego, even with the help of 
the ego ideal, does not adequately repre-
sent the contribution of the social envi-
ronment to language, self-knowledge. 
and intellectual and ethical self-manage-
ment; and the ego is a poor likeness of 
the personal repertoire acquired under 
the practical contingencies of daily life. 
The field known as the experimental 
analysis of behavior has extensively ex-
plored selection by consequences, but its 
conception of human behavior is resist-
ed. and many of its practical applica-
tions rejected, precisely because it has 
no place for a person as an initiating 
agent. The behavioral sciences at level iii 
show similar shortcomings. Anthropolo-
gy is heavily structural, and political 
scientists and economists usually treat 
the individual as a free initiating agent. 
Philosophy and letters offer no promising 
leads. 
A proper recognition of the selective 
action of the environment means a 
change in our conception of the origin of 
behavior which is possibly as extensive 
as that of the origin of species. So long as 
we cling to the view that a person is an 
initiating doer, actor, or causer of behav-
ior, we shall probably continue to ne-
glect the conditions which must be 
changed if we are to solve our problems
