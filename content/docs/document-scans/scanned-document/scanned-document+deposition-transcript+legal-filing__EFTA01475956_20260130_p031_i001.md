World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
For most other emerging markets, a positive outlook requires an end to 
commodity price declines and also an end to the puzzling weakness in exports. 
In Figure 8, we plot the growth in real exports of goods and services in the 
major EM economies by region against US and EU combined GDP growth. 
Aside from weighting EM countries by the size of their exports rather than 
GDP, 
we have made one other notable change, adjusting Chinese exports for alleged 
over-invoicing in early 2013. This latter modification serves to highlight 
that the 
decoupling of Asian exports from US and EU GDP growth is really a very 
recent phenomenon, emerging only in the last year. Growth in Emerging 
Europe exports has similarly decoupled from EU growth over the past year. 
Export growth in Latin America has been weak but reasonably closely aligned 
with US growth. 
Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the loss of export vitality, 
some of which we find unconvincing. "Onshoring" of manufacturing back to 
the US seems inconsistent with the weakness in US manufacturing output —
particularly in information and communications technology, which is the 
mainstay of Asian exports to the US. Manufacturing output growth in the EU 
has followed a similar pattern to imports, implying again that domestic 
production doesn't seem to be rising at the expense of imports. Indeed, 
import 
penetration into the US and European Union is not falling. While China has 
seen a loss of competitiveness in labour-intensive manufacturing, that has 
more than been offset by increasingly competitive higher-value industries. 
China now exports automobiles, high-speed trains and, soon, passenger jets; 
its share of global manufactured goods exports is rising today at about the 
same pace it was in the pre-crisis years. 
With only about a year's data, it is hard to arrive at a convincing 
explanation, 
but we think the following factors are important. First, slower growth in 
Chinese demand for commodity imports may have depressed overall export 
volumes among the commodity exporters. Second, those sectors that saw the 
greatest outward migration in production from advanced to emerging 
economies are now much more mature. Of particular importance, consumer 
electronics devices — mobile phones, laptops and tablets — are now ubiquitous 
in advanced economies and most emerging markets too. There simply doesn't 
need to be the growth in sales of such products since for most consumers the 
need simply is to replace worn-out devices. Third, as China moves up the 
value 
chain, production networks may be shrinking. As Chinese suppliers become 
more proficient, it may require fewer imports of intermediate goods to 
produce 
exports. And as multinationals in China focus more on serving the domestic 
market — now growing in USD terms as fast as the US market — they may be 
replacing more expensive imported components with locally sourced 'good 
enough' parts. Finally, the sharp depreciation of the euro in 2014 must 
surely 
have played a role, as the weak euro has depressed the growth of imports
