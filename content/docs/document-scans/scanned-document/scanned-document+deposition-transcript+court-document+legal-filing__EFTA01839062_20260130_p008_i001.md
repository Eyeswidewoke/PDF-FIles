account, she must have already left the room. If so, the sexual encounter had lasted no more than 
seven minutes. 
What took place between DSK and the maid in those intervening minutes is the subject of a 
civil lawsuit. In the maid's account, she encountered DSK in the entrance area when he emerged 
naked from the bedroom. He then dragged her first to the bedroom and then to the end of the 
interior corridor across from the bathroom, and there, after molesting her, he forced her to perform 
oral sex on him. 
In DSK's version, the maid was already standing just outside the bathroom door when he 
opened it. If so, she had crossed through the bedroom before he had encountered her. The sex act 
the took place and, according to him, was consensual.. 
After she left at 12:13 PM, it is not clear where she spent the time before she encountered 
another maid ay 12"30 PM or shortly afterwards. There are no CCTV cameras on the 28ih floor 
and she did not use here electronic key again until 12:26 PM, where she re-entered both room 
2820 and the Presidential suite. 
What is known from phone records is that DSK completed his call before 12:14 PM. He then 
dressed, put on his light black topcoat, and left the suite with bag and briefcase (which contained 
his iPad and several spare cell phones). As he recalls, he left no gratuity for his one night stay in 
the $5,000 a night presidential suite. He left at about 12:26 PM. At 12:27:08, he was recorded by 
the ground floor CCTV cameras arriving in the lobby. 
Meanwhile on the 281° floor, Diallo, just moments after DSK descended in the elevator, gad 
used her electronic key to re-enter the Presidential suite at 12:26 PM,. It was her third entry to 
the presidential suite in just 20 minutes, and she remained there very briefly before encountering 
the other maid in the hall.. 
Chapter III 
The Reconstruction of Reality 
The CCTV camera is increasingly become a part of modern life. Like many hotels built in the 
2P1 century, much of what happens at the Sofitel hotel is recorded by CCTV cameras. Outside, 
they are located at both the main entrance on 44th Street and the employees' entrance on 45'h
street. On the ground floor, they are located, among other places, in the concierge area, the main 
lobby, the lounge, the reception area, the elevator entranceway, the security office corridor, and 
the loading dock. They are also located in the sub-basement. There are no cameras on the upper 
floor corridors, elevators, or rooms. The photos from these cameras are digitally-stored and they 
can be viewed on a state-of-the-art monitor in the security office, located in the corridor between 
the employee entrance and the lobby. 
These cameras showed DSK's departure on 12:28:20 PM on May 10. DSK emerged in the 
elevator lobby at 12:27:12 PM. Fifty seconds later, at 12:28:03, the head engineer, Yearwood, 
emerged from another guest elevator. DSK proceeded to the reception desk at 12:28 PM. At 
12:28:30 PM, Yearwood also moved toward a vantage point in the lobby from which the 
reception area was visible. By 12:28:50 DSK had checked out and walked through the lobby exit 
to ite street. Yearwood was now also in the lobby, where one minute after DSK left, he met a 
woman in a pink cardigan. 
Yearwood then became part of the unfolding drama on the 28th floor shortly after DSK 
departure. At 12:39 PM, the head engineer can be seen on the CCTV tape receiving a phone call
