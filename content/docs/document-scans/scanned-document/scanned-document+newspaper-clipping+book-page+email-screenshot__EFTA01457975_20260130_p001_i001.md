Perspective from 
Larry V. Adam, U.S. Wealth Management CIO and Chief Investment Strategist 
Summer Doldrums Setting In 
While financial market volatility increased on the 
back of the Greek crisis and dramatic decline in the 
Chinese equity market (-32% from its recent peak), 
markets have stabilized. In fact, month-to-date 
through Thursday, the S&P 500 has rallied —2.3% 
and the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen -9 bps. 
The eye-popping stat was the intra-month "bear 
market" (fall of more than 20%) decline in oil. 
Moving into August, markets should remain range 
bound in what is traditionally a seasonably slow 
volume and muted performance month. The Q2 
2015 earnings season is in its latter stages with 
most of the systematically important bellwethers 
having already reported earnings. With eamings 
growth coming in better than expected (but still in 
slightly negative territory) and Q3 2015 earnings 
simultaneously being revised lower (very typical), 
there were no major surprises to earnings season. 
The Fed's next FOMC (Federal Open Market 
Committee) meeting is not until September 17-18 
and includes updated forecasts, "dots" (showing the 
dispersal of FOMC policy-makers' views) and 
Yellen's press conference. But until then, the Fed is 
likely to digest incoming data and remain "data 
dependent." However, if we are correct with our 
September first rate hike expectation, volatility 
should increase post Labor Day. A near-term 
calmness surrounding the Fed should contain the 
dollar and support a stabilization in commodity 
prices, which are currently oversold. 
Economic Data: Par for The Course 
As we expected, one of the primary reasons the 
Fed was noncommittal with its timing of the first 
rate hike with Wednesday's FOMC post-meeting 
announcement was they did not have the Q2 2015 
GDP and employment figures at their disposal. 
Yesterday's rebound in Q2 GDP (+2.3% QoQ) and 
upward revision to Q1 GDP (from -0.2% to 0.6% 
QoQ) is welcome news for the Fed and increases 
the likelihood of a September rate hike. 
Given the importance of economic momentum, 
next week's economic releases are expected to 
support the current trajectory of the economy with 
little change. After recently surging to its highest 
pace since July 2005, motor vehicle sales 
(Monday) for July are expected to remain above a 
17 million annualized pace (consensus 17.2 
million). 
The ISM manufacturing index (Monday) for July is 
expected to remain steady in expansionary territory 
at 53.5 (unchanged from last month). In particular, 
focus on the new orders and back orders 
subcomponents as they are better predictors of 
future economic activity. 
The employment report for July will be released on 
Friday. Our economist forecasts that 235K jobs 
were added in July and that the unemployment rate 
should remain unchanged at 5.3%. The estimated 
number of jobs for July is consistent with the 
average monthly pace of -208K jobs created YTD. 
Given the Fed's emphasis on employment 
conditions (both job creation and wages), this is 
one of two reports the Fed will have before its next 
meeting.
