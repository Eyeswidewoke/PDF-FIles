Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
AB ACQUISITION LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This ASU is 
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 for publicly traded companies and interim 
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company 
early adopted ASU 2015-03 as of March 1, 2015. As a result of the adoption, the Company retrospectively reclassified $187.8 million and 
$47.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as of February 28, 2015 and February 20, 2014, respectively, from Other assets to a 
reduction in long-term debt. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations 
or the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards: In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers- (Topic 606). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised 
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a 
customer. 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to 
the performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. For 
public entities, this pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is not 
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement. 
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-04, 'Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the 
Measurement Date of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets." This ASU gives an employer whose fiscal year-end 
does not coincide with a calendar month-end (e.g., an entity that has a 52- or 53-week fiscal year) the ability, as a practical expedient, to 
measure defined benefit retirement obligations and related plan assets as of the month-end that is closest to its fiscal year-end. This 
amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15. 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early 
application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU. 
Note 2—Acquisitions 
Safeway acquisition 
On January 30, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Safeway by acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Safeway for 
cash consideration of $34.92 per share, or $8,263.5 million, and issuing contingent value rights of $1.0266 and $0.0488 per share 
relating to Safeway's 49% interest in Casa Ley and deferred consideration related to Safeway's previous sale of the Property 
Development Centers, LLC ("PDC) assets, respectively, for an aggregate fair value of $270.9 million. The Casa Ley contingent value 
right will entitle the holder to a pro rata share of the net proceeds from the sale of Casa Ley. In the event that Casa Ley is not sold prior 
to January 30, 2018, holders of the Casa Ley contingent value rights will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of the fair market 
value of such remaining interest minus certain fees, expenses and assumed taxes that would have been deducted from the proceeds of 
a sale of Casa Ley. The PDC contingent value right will entitle the holder to a pro rata share of the net proceeds from any deferred 
consideration relating to the previous sale of the PDC assets. At the time of the acquisition, Safeway operated 1,325 supermarkets under 
the banners Safeway, Vons, Pavilions, Randalls, Tom Thumb and Carrs Quality Centers, with an extensive network of distribution, 
manufacturing and food processing facilities. Safeway also owned and operated GroceryWorks.com Operating Company, LLC an online 
grocery channel. The acquisition was financed through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from existing members.
