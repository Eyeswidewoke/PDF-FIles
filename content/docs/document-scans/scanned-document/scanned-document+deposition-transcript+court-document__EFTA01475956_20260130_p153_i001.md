World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
US Equity Strategy: Still-low treasury yields despite Fed 
hikes to boost S&P PE — Heavy tilts to Health Care & Tech 
IIWe recently cut 2016E S&P EPS by $3 to $125 on revised assumptions of 
even lower oil prices and a stronger dollar, but this is still about 5% EPS 
growth from 2015. We believe an 18x trailing PE is fair provided the climb 
in Treasury yields is moderate as the Fed hikes. Thus, S&P PE expansion 
should provide an additional few percent upside. Our S&P targets are 2100 
for 2015 end and 2250 for 2016 end or up 5-10%. 
II2015E S&P EPS is $119, up 0.5% despite sales down 4%, buoyed by net 
margins climbing to a record high and about 1.5% share shrink. Ex. Energy 
& Financials, as much less y/y litigation expense at Banks, 2015 S&P EPS 
was up 6% or 10% ex. 4% FX drag. Growth led by Health Care and big 
consumer oriented Tech firms. We expect growth to slow at these two 
S&P segments, but remain key growth drivers. 
II2016E S&P EPS of $125 is up 5% on 4% sales growth, flat margins and 1% 
share shrink. Sales should turn positive in 2016 as commodity and 
currency drags diminish and sales better connects with US GDP. We 
assume WTI oil averages $55/bbl in 2016 and that DXY averages 100 with 
euro at $1.05 within DXY. This is a 1.5% FX drag to sales vs. 4% in 2015. If 
euro is $0.95 then drag is 2.5%, if DXY is 110 then 4%. 
IISales growth and PE should be the main drivers of performance in 2016. 
But few sectors offer both strong sales growth and sizable PE upside. 
Health Care does and should outperform in 2016 on sales-driven superior 
EPS growth and a higher PE. Health Care is the biggest and fastestgrowing 
part of US consumer spending. We're excited about the supply of 
life-enhancing products and the demographic 'destiny' of greater demand. 
Health Care is cheaper than the S&P, which is very unusual, despite a 
superior growth profile, balance sheets and less cyclicality. The political 
risks seem rather exaggerated beyond Managed Care. 
IIOur 2250 S&P target or 18x trailing 2016E S&P EPS is a PE 10-15% above 
history and highest on S&P EPS post a cyclical recovery other than the late 
1990s. But we believe it's fair given persistently low long-term real 
interest 
rates. If Fed Funds and 10yr Treasury yields rise slowly and plateau around 
2% and 3.0-3.5% (10yr TIPS yield <1.5%) in late 2017, then an 18x trailing 
PE looks fair on normalized S&P EPS — about 15x for Financials & Energy 
and 20x aggregate profits of other sectors. This assumes a fair real return 
on long-term S&P investment of 5.5%. A fair PE is 1/real CoE when future 
real EPS growth + dividend yield equals the real CoE. 
Health Care and Tech are why we are bullish on the S&P 500 for 2016. 
Energy and Industrials worry us a great deal. Most of the rest of the 
market, both the S&P and the Russell 2000, seem fully valued except a few 
big Banks, Utilities, Airlines, and some of our specific stock picks.
