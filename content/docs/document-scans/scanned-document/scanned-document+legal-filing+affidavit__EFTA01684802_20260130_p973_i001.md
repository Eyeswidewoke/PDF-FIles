Before beginning mediation, you or we must first send a claim notice. Within 30 days after sending or 
receiving a claim notice, you or we may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com) or the 
American Arbitration Association (-AAA") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org) for mediation. We will pay the fees of 
the mediator. 
All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All 
applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. Either you or we may 
terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect 
your or our right to elect arbitration. 
Arbitration 
You or we may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. Claims are decided by a neutral 
arbitrator. 
If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor we will have the right to litigate that claim in 
cowl or have a jury trial on that claim. Further, you and we will not have the right to participate in a 
representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. 
Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is 
more limited. The arbitrators decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to 
very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and 
binding. Other rights you or we would have in court may also not be available in arbitration. 
Initiating Arbitration 
Before beginning arbitration, you or we must first send a claim notice. Claims will be referred to either 
JAMS or MA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this 
Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where 
those rules conflict with these Terms & ConditionS. If we choose the organization, you may select the 
other within 30 days after receiving notice of our selection. Contact JAMS or AM to begin an arbitration 
or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and we 
agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 
U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (FAA). 
We will not elect arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual 
and pending only in that court. You or we may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless 
it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered. Either you or we may 
delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, including the right to arbitrate a 
claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights. 
Limitations on Arbitration 
If either party elects to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual 
basis. There will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis 
or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the 
general public, other cardmembers or other persons similarly situated. 
The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or 
consolidated unless you and we agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it 
will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. 
Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion 
of these Limitations on Arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration 
provision (other than this sentence) will not apply. 
Arbitration Procedures 
This Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, 
statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil 
procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on 
Arbitration, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be 
confidential, but you may notify any govemment authority of your claim.
