UBS Client Relationship Agreement 
• 
Shareholder communications, including annual and other shareholder reports, 
preliminary and final prospectuses, proxy materials and information about other 
corporate actions. Shareholder communications also includes all account documents 
related to Investment Advisory accounts, including Form ADV disclosure brochures, 
manager profiles, asset allocations, performance reports and other disclosures, reports 
and notices related to advisory accounts. 
• 
Quarterly performance reports. 
• 
Corporate Employee Financial Services plan advices. 
• 
Tax reporting documents, including 1099s and other tax documents that are available 
now or become available in the future. 
• 
Agreements and disclosures relating to the accounts, features and services we offer. 
Any member of your household may enroll any other household account in electronic 
delivery of these periodic communications, except for tax reporting documents. By 
enrolling in e-Delivery of any communications described above, you agree that we may 
also deliver similar firm documents electronically that may be available now or in the 
future. When available, confirmations of your personal and account information may be 
included with related documents that are delivered electronically through UBS Online 
Services or any other secure method. Please note: These confirmations are sent 
periodically and to confirm certain changes to your account information. These 
confirmations may be viewable by other members of your household through UBS Online 
Services or other secure methods. Contact your Financial Advisor if you prefer to receive 
private, paper versions of confirmations of personal and account information instead of 
electronic versions. 
If you enroll in e-Delivery for any of the communications described above, the following 
terms and conditions will apply to all of the UBS accounts (current and future) in your UBS 
statement household. 
• 
A valid e-mail address is required for our e-Delivery services and you are responsible 
for notifying UBS when your e-mail address changes; you may update your e-mail 
address online through UBS Online Services or by calling your Financial Advisor. 
• 
Access to UBS Online Services is required for e-Delivery of documents that contain any 
personal information; we may, however, deliver such documents by other secure 
means in the future. 
• 
Enrollment in e-Delivery is effective immediately and may be cancelled at any time, 
either by changing your elections online or by contacting your Financial Advisor; we 
confirm cancellations and other changes to your delivery preferences by email or 
regular mail whether they were initiated by you or UBS. 
• 
Enrollment for any e-Delivery services for any of your accounts will automatically apply 
to any accounts that you open in the future at UBS, subject to certain system 
limitations. 
• 
You may request paper copies of any document we are required to deliver to you at 
any time for no additional charge by contacting your Financial Advisor. 
• 
We notify you by e-mail when a new document is available; to protect your 
information, the electronic message generally includes a link to a secure UBS website 
where the document can be viewed and downloaded. 
• 
If your email address fails, we will mail paper copies of documents or a paper notice 
that a document is available with instructions on how to access it. 
• 
By enrolling in e-Delivery, you confirm that you have access to a printer or other device 
to print or save documents you may wish to retain. 
• 
We do not charge for e-Delivery, but your Internet access provider may have separate 
charges. 
Please see the section Householding 
of Statements and Other 
Communications above for further

household is established.
