M. Harciarek a al. 
illuminate the features of epilepsy. In his view, nega-
tive symptoms were the loss of vital properties that 
could cause conditions such as paralysis or anaesthe-
sia, while positive symptoms were the excess of vital 
properties resulting in conditions such as spasms, 
pain or convulsions. Although both could be observed 
at the same time, Reynolds believed that positive and 
negative symptoms were independent of each other 
(Berrios, 1985). Expanding on Reynolds idea, 
Hughlings Jackson (1958) conceptualized positive 
symptoms as the result of the loss of higher inhibitory 
mechanisms that permitted excitation or the dis-
charge of lower neural systems and negative symp-
toms as the result of reduced neural function. Unlike 
Reynolds, Jackson believed that positive and negative 
symptoms were different manifestations of a single 
process. Kraepelin (1919) and Bleuler (1908) 
adopted Jackson's theory of positive and negative 
symptoms in their conceptualizations of schizophre-
nia. A shared aetiopathophysiology for cases of 
schizophrenia and FTD would be most consistent 
with Jackson's model. Deterioration of frontal lobes 
with secondary release of positive symptoms would 
fit this view. 
As already suggested, similarity of symptomatol-
ogy of schizophrenia and FTD and the potential for 
diagnostic confusion between them has been noted 
by several authors (Duggal & Singh, 2009; Vander-
zeypen et al., 2003; Velakoulis et al., 2009; Wadding-
ton et al., 1995). This seems to be a serious clinical 
problem, especially since both the therapeutic inter-
ventions and prognosis of these disorders are quite 
different. 
Schizophrenia is normally characterized by the 
onset of so-called positive symptoms (e.g. delusions, 
hallucinations) during adolescence or young adult-
hood. Nonetheless, similarly to FTD, the clinical 
presentation of schizophrenia is heterogeneous, 
encompassing also a variety of negative symptoms, 
such as lack of volition, personal neglect, social with-
drawal, and such cognitive symptoms as executive 
deficit and/or language impairment. The neuropsy-
chological profile identified in schizophrenic patients 
is usually characterized by executive deficits (Ber-
man et al., 1986), although they are often less severe 
than seen in FTD. Although dementia is not typically 
considered to occur in schizophrenia, nor is it clearly 
recognized as an obligatory complication of this dis-
order, many subjects with schizophrenia develop dis-
orientation and cognitive impairment (de Vries et al., 
2001). Furthermore, later-life cognitive deterioration 
in a subset of schizophrenic patients is well described 
(Harvey, 2012); such schizophrenia cases have some-
times been called 'Kraepelinian subtypes' in the 
research literature. 
The exact mechanism or mechanisms underlying 
positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia 
remains an open question. It is possible that whereas 
positive symptoms are related to an increase in dop-
amine in the mesolimbic pathway, a defective dop-
amine function in the mesocortical pathway may 
contribute to the development of negative symptoms 
(Weinberger & Berman, 1988). Further, it has been 
proposed that negative symptoms represent a conse-
quence of impaired frontal lobe function (Berge 
et al., 2011; Frith, 1992; Liddle, 1987; Weinberger, 
1988). In fact, when Kraepelin (1919) introduced 
the concept of 'dementia praecox', he suggested that, 
based on the symptomatology of schizophrenia, it 
should be considered a frontotemporal disorder. 
Also, many authors have noted that the affective flat-
tening, lack of volition, poor judgement, personal 
neglect and social withdrawal seen in many patients 
with schizophrenia are among symptoms typically 
seen in subjects with disease of the frontal lobe (Frith, 
1992; Levin, 1984; Liddle, 1987; Pantelis et al., 
1992; Weinberger, 1988; Winograd-Gurvich et al., 
2006). Additionally, it has been shown that such 
negative symptoms are related to defective perfor-
mance on neuropsychological tests sensitive to fron-
tal lobe function, on tests of attention and executive 
abilities in particular (Dibben et al., 2009; Donohoe 
et al., 2006). 
Although clinical signs of schizophrenia are 
similar to those seen in frontal dysfunction, and 
thus, may overlap with symptoms of FTD, only few 
recent studies directly compared the symptomatol-
ogy of schizophrenia and FTD (Kosmidis et al., 
2008; Weickert et al., 2011; Velakoulis et al., 2009; 
Ziauddeen et al., 2011). Ziauddeen et al. (2011) 
compared a small group of negative-symptom 
schizophrenic patients and patients with the behav-
ioural variant FTD and found that both groups 
displayed negative symptoms typically seen after 
frontal lobe injury. Specifically, high rate of apathy, 
loss of empathy and stereotypic behaviours were 
noted in both conditions. Also, patients with 
schizophrenia presented with a relatively similar 
neuropsychological profile to those with FTD on 
neuropsychological tests, both groups particularly 
impaired on tests of executive functions, although 
this impairment was greater in FTD. Further, 
speech abnormalities were seen in both disorders, 
although they were more common in patients with 
schizophrenia (the latter finding being inconclu-
sive, since subjects with the language variant FTD 
were not included in the study). Kosmidis et al. 
(2008) compared patients with schizophrenia with 
those suffering from FTD and found impaired per-
formance on measures of theory of mind in both 
groups. Weickert et al. (2011) showed that impaired 
probabilistic association learning is equally impaired 
in schizophrenia and in FTD (particularly in the 
behavioural variant).
