On Mo, MC2 and more 
Posted on May 19, 2007 at 01:53:12 PM by Industry Junkie 
This is not a direct response to the Mo Wan Dan move from Next to MC2 which is why it is it's own 
topic. But I do want to mention that you may see more gravitation to MC2. Having worked out the 
accounting department issues they may be a future force to reckon with. Alot of people do not 
know Jeff Fuller on a personal level but you will be hard pressed to find a more solid well rounded 
agent to lead that organization and he has resurrected things with his back against the wall and it 
appears the dust is majorly settling. With the combined efforts of Jeff's full time return to New 
York, Jean Luc Brunel's legendary scouting, and tenured fashion purist Adrian Hidalgo I think the 
place is going to start rolling out some significant results in the next several seasons. I might be 
optomistic since I have a couple personal relationships over there but also lest we forget that Jean 
Luc Brunel was also one of the original founders of Next with Faith Kates prior to the Wilkenfeld 
Spectrum merger(now I am dating myself at well over 40 years old yikes). Regardless, this 
business runs in cycles and always will. Agencies like Marilyn, One, and MC2 are the true future 
agencies to come knocking on the doors of IMG, Women, and DNA. Today's development is back to 
the basics...most of the girls on the recent vogue cover did not start last season the time has been 
invested. Those agencies I mentioned of the future have some nice loaves of bread cooking in the 
oven.
