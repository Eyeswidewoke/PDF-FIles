glad to see you are personally =AO on the mend - as well as the fence. -- As you know i dread money discussions 
w=th you-- however -we should address the issue of what you would like to do moving forward. re- do famil= office, 
accounting trusts , estate and apollo agreements . Along with=20 your " payment " last year we agreed . no further 
obligati=ns on each side. yes, i continued to moan. I realize that though =AO I ve done quite a lot this year already , it 
is not your responsibility. . As you =ften like to remind me- you've paid a great deal of money to date. tha= being said - 
If you want my involvement moving foward, I sug=est you pay my regular I fee of 40 m . 20 now . 20 on completion 
or as per the=20 invoice issues at the end of last year pay 30 all at once= - 
To help out . im keenly aware o= your current cash position. so I will consider an in-kin= payment - 
real estate
Miami )„art , financing of my new plane (allows you to spread over years or of course the preferred cash. Get ri= of 
Castrucci,it is over a year since the same story of findign the =ight guy at the top. you entire accounting needs to 
be=re done. , office downsized, reporting re done. meetings to reciti=y, categlorize , the various docs re appollo , 
rowen suydam, alan etc.=20 Brad can direct investment guys, ( hopefully) my people will be in y=ur office for a few 
months . reorganizing IF you decide not to pay I fu=ly understand, as I m sure you will re my no longer spending any 
serious=time on these things. 
Of course re any non financial issues, I am always there for you and will continue to be=C2 the best friend I can be . 
Steve jobs said that everyday h= woke up, and asked himself , if he knew he was going to die tomorow , would he do 
the s=me thing that he had planned for the day- he wanted to check that he was doing things=20 that he really wanted 
to. after three days of getting back an answer =f no, he would change what he was going to do. . he also did 
not=believe in LONG term plans. I dont think either one of us will figur= out what we want to do long term so my 
thinking is that=we should try to have fun everyday, and welcome serendipity. 
I think another trust and estate lawyer should be brough= in to deal with the issues of how not to allow your family to 
get s=rewed by your partners on death . Alan, for years told m= that paul weiss had drawn the docs so no issue but 
when =recently pushed by my new fire drill he asked akin to draft .?= Please ask brad about why he keeps talking 
about flow . =C2 I dont know what he means, its so silly .. this i= only about money control and protection . 
I am lea=ing monday night now. free to speak in the afternoon
