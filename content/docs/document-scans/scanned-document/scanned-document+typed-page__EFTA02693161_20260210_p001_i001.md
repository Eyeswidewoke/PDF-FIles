Introduction 
ABSTRACT 
During reaching or drawing, the primate cortex carries information about the current and upcoming position 
of the hand. Researchers have decoded hand position. velocity. and acceleration during center-out reaching 
or drawing tasks from neural recordings acquired invasively at the microscale and mesoscale levels. Here we 
report that we can continuously decode information about hand velocity at the macroscale level from 
magnetoencephalography (MEG) data acquired from the scalp during a center-out drawing task with an 
imposed hand-cursor rotation. The grand mean (ri = 5) correlation coefficients (CCs) between measured and 
decoded velocity profiles were 0.48. 0.40. 0.38. and 0.28 for the horizontal dimension of movement and 0.32. 
0.49. 0.56, and 023 for the vertical dimension of movement where the order of the CCs indicates pre-
exposure. early-exposure. late-exposure, and post-exposure to the hand-cursor rotation. By projecting the 
sensor contributions to decoding onto whole-head scalp maps. we found that a macroscale sensorimotor 
network carries information about detailed hand velocity and that contributions from sensors over central 
and parietal scalp areas change due to adaptation to the rotated environment. Moreover, a 3-D linear 
estimation of distributed current sources using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic 
tomography (sLORETA) permitted a more detailed investigation into the cortical network that encodes for 
hand velocity in each of the adaptation phases. Beneficial implications of these findings include a non-
invasive methodology to examine the neural correlates of behavior on a macroscale with high temporal 
resolution and the potential to provide continuous, complex control of a non-invasive neuromotor prosthesis 
for movement-impaired individuals. 
In the last several decades, great strides have been made in 
revealing how the primate cortex may encode the current and 
upcoming position of the hand in space during reaching or drawing 
(Scott 2008). In addition to contributing to the body of neuroscientific 
knowledge, these discoveries have begun to beneficially impact 
society. Greater elucidation of the neural code for hand movement 
has served as an impetus to the development of brain-controlled 
prostheses for the movement-impaired population. Prior to the 
advent of brain-controlled prostheses, several seminal discoveries 
laid a foundation with arguably the most momentous discovery being 
that of a population vector code for the direction of hand movement in 
three-dimensions (Georgopoulos et al.. 1986: Kettner et al.. 1988). At 
the beginning of this century. researchers launched the field of brain-
controlled neuromotor prostheses with the application of the 
population vector algorithm as well as other methods to extract

control signals related to hand movement from neural data (Schwartz 
et al.. 2001). Researchers have demonstrated the ability to decode 
hand kinematics at the microscale from neuronal signals acquired 
with microwires or microelectrode arrays seated into small patches of 
sensorimotor cortical tissue and to use this information to drive a 
cursor or robotic arm (Wessberg et al.. 2000; Serruya et al.. 2002: 
Taylor et al.. 2002: Hochberg et al.. 2006: Santhanam et at. 2006: 
Truccolo et al., 2008: Velliste et al.. 2008: Mulliken et al., 2008). Other 
intracranial studies have analyzed neural data at the mesoscale with 
coarser spatial resolution but wider spatial extent from local field 
potential (LFP) recordings. For example, hand movement direction 
and two-dimensional trajectories have been decoded from LFPs 
(Mehring el al.. 2003. 2004; Leuthardt et al.. 2004; Rickert et at. 
2005: Scherberger et al., 2.005; Schalk et al., 2007: Pistohl et al., 2008; 
Sanchez et al., 2008). 
In the late 1990s, pioneering work on the macroscale began to 
relate scalp potentials acquired non-invasively to hand movement 
(Kelso et at, 1998: 0•Suilleabhain et al., 1999). Some recent non-
invasive studies have demonstrated the presence of a macroscale 
network that carries the neural code for detailed hand movement. For 
instance, hand movement direction has been decoded from electro-
encephalography ( EEG) and MEG data (I lam mon et al.. 2008; Walden
