Nevertheless, there is widespread concern that corporate speech routinely impedes the 
development of sound public policy. Here I pursue the theoretical case that we do indeed 
have a corporate speech problem, ^a and I explore a possible solution to the problem which 
does not [` 192] require the kind of corporate censorship that the Supreme Court has 
disallowed on First Amendment grounds. 
Specifically, I argue that corporate speech can be usefully reformed by altering 
corporate law. I argue for the institutionalization of firm governance dynamics which will 
change the way that corporations speak to and about their shareholders, workers, 
consumers, the community at large, and government. This approach seeks to solve the 
corporate speech problem by generating more socially useful corporate speech, rather 
than constraining or silencing it through external governmental regulation. 
I. THE PROBLEM OF CORPORATE SPEECH 
A. The Source of Corporate Power 
While many organisms communicate, the human ability to deploy elaborate expressive 
and representational systems in a community of similarly capable individuals is among the 
defining attributes of our species. ^9 In the longue duree of human history speech has 
played a crucial part in our ability to achieve the coordination necessary to build and 
maintain civilization. This is not to say that speech explains it all-sheer force, inexpressible 
love, the tides, the winds, the will, all of these are also essential components of the human 
condition. But speech is an important category in any conception of the important elements 
of human life. In contemporary society, the corporation is among the most significant 
institutions that organizes, produces, circulates and listens to speech acts. 
Corporations are powerful institutions because they can efficiently coordinate the 
activity of many individuals and groups, including holders of capital, workers, and 
consumers. ifi° This capacity for coordination is generated by the corporation's centralized, 
authoritative decision-making structure. ri" The corporation's board of directors makes all 
decisions about how the resources brought by each group will be deployed. Various 
stakeholders all accede to the boards' deci p193] sions, or else they do no business with 
the firm. The coordinating power of the board is a beautiful thing. The consumer who 
wakes in the morning desiring an intemet-ready cell phone need not drive down the street 
looking for electronic engineers, designers, and programmers with whom she might set up 
a meeting to talk about producing the item in exchange for her cash. The coal miner need 
not say each morning to some holder of capital that she is skilled in the hefting of the pick 
and knows a good place for digging, the two then writing a contract over breakfast 
regarding what land should be purchased for digging on that afternoon. Instead labor and 
capital both submit their particular assets to the centralized decision-making structure of 
the firm, which deploys the labor and capital in the most beneficial way, returning wages 
and profits to labor and capital far greater than either could have generated on their own. 
The consumer is offered a pre-designed, internet-ready phone on a take-it-or-leave-it basis 
at a specified price, undoubtedly cheaper than she could have come up with on her own.
The authoritative decision-making advantage of the firm, brilliant as it is, also 
constitutes one of the corporation's greatest design flaws. Having turned over control of
