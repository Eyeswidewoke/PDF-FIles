Cabin/Cockpit Temperature 
Controllers 
The crew exercises control over the compart-
ment temperature by manipulation of the se-
lector rheostat, located on the overhead panel 
in the cockpit. Manually moving the rheostat 
changes the resistance, and this change is re-
flected back to the controller, thereby adjust-
ing the desired temperature. 
Five temperature-sensitive elements, two 
cabin/cockpit temperature sensors, one cock-
pit temperature sensor, and two cabin/cockpit 
duct temperature anticipators, supply addi-
tional information electrically to the 
cabin/cockpit temperature controller relating 
compartment temperature, duct temperature, 
and the temperature of the air exhausted from 
the compartment involved. These factors are 
compared to the desired temperature infor-
mation from the selector rheostat and solid-
state controller, and then a DC output signal 
is routed to the air pressure regulator valves 
which control the cabin/cockpit temperature 
control valve positions. Additional functions 
of the anticipator are to provide a rate of 
change control over the system and also to 
sense when the duct temperature has reached 
the maximum allowable value. 
Cabin/Cockpit Temperature 
Sensors 
The temperature sensors are dual-element, 
consisting of two separate sections. One sec-
tion provides temperature information to the 
cabin/cockpit temperature controllers, while 
the other element is actually a temperature 
bulb for the cabin air temperature indicator 
(digital), the overhead panel in the cockpit. 
Crossover Function Operation
 
To pressurize both refrigeration units us' 2
both engines, position the L and R 
BLEED AIR switches to ON. This energizes 
both bleed-air pressure regulator and 
shutoit 
valves open, allowing bleed-air pressure to 
the air-conditioning shutoff and control valves.
Placing the L and R PACK switches tot" al. 
lows bleed air to flow through these valves If, 
the refrigeration units, where it is conditioned 
to the desired temperature and routed to the
cabin/cockpit. 
In the event of the loss of one engine, place the
BLEED AIR switch for the operating engine 
to ON and the inoperative engine BLEED AIR 
switch to OFF. Placing the ISOLATION s%itch 
to OPEN allows the single engine to pressur-
ize the whole bleed-air manifold. For full air 
conditioning place the L and R PACK switches 
to ON. 
In the event of the loss of one refrigeration unit. 
place the inoperative side PACK switch to 
OFF, and ensure that the BLEED AIR switch 
and PACK switch for the operating side are in 
ON. With the PACK switch for the operatite 
side ON, bleed air is routed from the engine 
through the air-conditioning system shutoff 
and control valve and through the operating re-
frigeration unit to the cabin or cockpit.
