I remember how I played with neural networks as a student, and stumbled =n a solution where I could speed up the 
learning dramatically by =etting the network estimate how well it knew certain parts of the =roblem space, and focus its 
learning on that area. The next step was to =et the net decide what training data it wanted to look at. Obviously, =sking 
is better than observing. But for current Al systems, questions =re much, much harder, of course, at least in the general 
case. To ask a =uestion, I must know what I do not know, and I must know what someone =Ise knows, and how to 
translate and fit the answer into my knowledge. =onsequently, even people seem to find asking much harder than 
=nswering. (Different rules may apply to socially regulated contexts.) 
Children ask "true questions", in which they try to form complex models =or the first time. Once people have a model in 
place, they tend to only =sk for variables ("at which time does the train leave"), and when they =onverse about each 
others life, they tend not to be interested in model =evisions, but in mapping what they hear to existing variants of the 
=stablished. This seems to be even true when scientists extend their =heories: the natural inclination seems to be to find 
supporting =vidence to allow me to let the model stay in place, and simply adjust =t. Since a model revision would 
require to adjust all inferences and =onnections tied to the discarded model, this makes sense. 
Looking at question asking systems seems to be an extremely promising =venue for Al research. I suppose we have to 
treat knowledge classes =uite differently: questions about basic linguistic structure can only =e answered by other 
speakers. Questions about conceptual maps can only =e inferred from statements of others. Questions about content 
can in =rinciple be deduced from individual observations, and asking questions =to others) is simply a shortcut. 
The nature of question-asking seems to differ significantly between most =spergers and most neurotypicals. The former 
try to find out what is =rue, with the null hypothesis usually being that their own idea is =ight when it conflicts with what 
others tell them. Aspergers tend to =hange their opinions based on how they judge the logical truth of the =rguments of 
the other side. Neurotypicals tend to look for the "right" =nswer, not the true one, i.e. they try to align themselves with 
the =entiments and norms of people they assign social status. The primary =echanism for this seems to be "emotional 
synesthesia", i.e. they =iterally feel the emotions of other people as their own, including the =ense of rightfulness that 
accompanies a statement. Successful speakers =an project both conviction and high social status. Neurotypicals erect 
=ocial boundaries to a large extent to avoid "infection" with "bad" =pinions. I find that my intuitions about building Al 
(and about forming =nowledge, negotiating norms etc.) are largely influenced by being not =eurotypical (and that is 
definitely true for the most capable people in =he field). It is very visible in Marvin Minsky and Noam Chomsky, I =hink. I 
wonder what we are missing, especially since my intuitions and =pparent experience tell me that non-nerds rarely 
stumble on the right =nswers to complex problems. 
What do you think?
