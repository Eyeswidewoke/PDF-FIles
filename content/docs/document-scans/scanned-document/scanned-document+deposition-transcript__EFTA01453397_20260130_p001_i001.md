Viktorovich Bushmin, deputy speaker of the Federation Council of 
the Russian Federation; Andrei Fursenko, an aide to Putin; 
Vladimir Yakunin, chief executive officer of OAO Russian 
Railways; billionaire Gennady Timchenko, a co-founder of oil 
trader Gunvor Group Ltd; businessman Arkady Rotenberg, a former 
judo partner of Putin whose companies won more than S7 billion 
of contracts for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and his 
brother, Boris, and Yuri Kovalchuk, a partner at Bank Rossiya, 
according to a list released by the Treasury Department. 
Eight of the 20 were previously designated by the EU. 
The sanctions, based on an executive order issued March 17, 
ban the individuals' entry, freeze any personal assets they may 
have in the U.S. and bar them from doing business with any U.S. 
company or financial institution. 
A U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity to discuss the details, said the individuals won't 
have access to any U.S. financial services and will have 
difficulty conducting transactions in dollars. Bank Rossiya also 
will be frozen out of dollar transactions. 
Russian Economy 
Obama also signed a new executive order, his third in 
response to the Ukraine crisis, authorizing though not 
implementing economic sanctions affecting parts of the Russian 
economy. They included financial services, energy, metals and 
mining, defense and engineering. 
"This is not our preferred outcome," he said. "These 
sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the 
Russian economy, but also could be disruptive to the global 
economy." 
Russian stocks traded in New York fell the most in more 
than two weeks after Obama's announcement. The Bloomberg Russia-
U.S. Equity index of the most-traded Russian shares in the U.S. 
dropped 3.3 percent to 80.10 at 4 p.m. in New York. 
Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Russia to negative 
because of the risks posed by the conflict, affirming Russia's 
credit rated at BBB, the second-lowest investment grade. 
Russia's Reaction 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was surprised 
by some of the names on today's list, and considers the use of 
sanctions unacceptable. It's not true that Putin is an investor 
in Gunvor as the U.S. alleges, he said. 
In retaliation for the new U.S. sanctions, the Russian 
government barred entry of nine U.S. officials, including House 
Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee Chairman Robert Menendez of New Jersey. 
"The speaker is proud to be included on a list of those 
willing to stand against Putin's aggression," Boehner's 
spokesman, Michael Steel, said in an e-mail. 
Edward J. Krauland, a partner at the law firm Steptoe & 
Johnson who's a specialist on international sanctions, said 
targeting individuals probably won't have a big an impact on 
Russia's actions. Hitting Russian economic sectors would. 
"I don't even think if they targeted Putin it would bring 
Mr. Putin to the table," Krauland said. "If you can isolate 
particular sectors of a country's economy that are significant, 
disproportionate parts of the economy, you're going to impose a 
hurt on that country."
