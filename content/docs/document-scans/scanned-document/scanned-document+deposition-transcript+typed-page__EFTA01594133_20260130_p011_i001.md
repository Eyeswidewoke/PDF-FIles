Royal protection 
officers accused of being drunk while guarding the Queen, sitting on her 
throne and trading pornography on duty will not be disciplined. The 
allegations emerged during the trial of a policeman convicted yesterday of 
masterminding a £3 million betting scam at Buckingham Palace. Paul Page, 
38, from Scotland Yard's S014 Royal Protection Command, told Southwark Crown 
Court that officers regularly fell asleep at the Palace and at St James's 
Palace. He said they also played poker on duty and smuggled friends into 
garden parties or let them park in palace grounds while shopping in the West 
End. 
Page, 38, claimed that some officers routinely slept off hangovers 
in private palace rooms, handled firearms while drunk and sold steroids. 
Douglas Day, QC, prosecuting, dismissed the claims as "pie in the sky" and 
"nothing more than diversionary tactics" designed to cloud [Page's] "blatant 
dishonesty". Claims about members of the Royal Family were kept from the 
jury after the prosecution argued that they were irrelevant. But in a 
defence statement, Page referred to a series of alleged security breaches at 
Buckingham Palace. The Duke of York was said to have entertained women 
there, including Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Robert Maxwell. Iif
It was suggested that women were allowed in without going through security 
procedures and that police had sometimes to drive them home. Prince Andrew 
was also accused of ordering his protection officer to stand about 100 yards 
away, while he practised his golf swing, to collect the balls.MNIThe Duke of 
Edinburgh allegedly told officers not to walk on the gravel path outside his 
bedroom window in case they woke him up, insisting that they kept to the 
grass. Page also claimed that the Queen owns a yellow rubber duck that has a 
tiny gold crown painted on its head.ONIThe court heard that he ran a spread 
betting syndicate, the Currency Club at the Palace. When the losses mounted 
to hundreds of thousands of pounds, he tried to recoup money with a bogus 
property investment scheme promising fantastic returns. At least 20 officers 
parted with more than £1.3 million and there were 40 other victims, one 
losing £260,000. Page used the money for gambling, spent £120,000 hiring 
Porsches, Mercedes and Range Rovers, and funded his wife's shopping spreesil-
OThe father of five from Grays, Essex, blamed apathy among protection 
officers on the sense that police were looked down on by the Royal 
Household. "People would go to sleep on post. Officers would turn up drunk. 
I've turned up with a hangover. Officers in the command are earning £50,000 
to £60,000 per year with overtime for doing very little," he said. One 
colleague imported pornography from the Netherlands and sold it on duty, he 
claimed. "Everyone knew about it, but no one would say anything. You had
