Second, we eliminate the double ontology which requires that both the positions of the particles and the wavefunction be 
beables. This can be criticized as an extravogent hypothesis, which makes the world as ontologically bizzare as interpretations 
such as many worlds that posit the reality of the quantum state. 
However, the lesson of Nelson's formulation 141, is that, as explained in l5l, one cannot succeed in making the whole wave-
function just a derived property of an ensemble, derived from the values of configurations of individual systems. Given the form 
of the wavefunction,

it is certainly appropriate to regard the probability density p(x,t) as a property of the ensemble and we will do so. But it is much 
more challenging to regard the phase .5(x,r) as derived from an ensemble. For one thing, the deterministic evolution equation for 
the position beable of deBrogle-Bohm theory has the velocity depend on S(.r,t). But, if the rates of change of beables depend 
on S(x,i) it seems that by our principle of explanatory closure, S(.r,i ) must also be a beable, or must be determined by beables. 
But then this contradicts our second principle of no unreciprocated influence and we find ourselves in trouble. 
To get out of trouble we take a new approach to this conundrum. We posit that each individual microscopic system has a 
second beable, which is a phase. e*. We also posit that the dynamics forces these to a class of configurations in which they 
come to depend on the other beables E. Hence " 
, where at is the value of the beable A in the system /. Once that is the 
case the information to determine the function SC; 0 is to be found distributed in the phase beables of all the individual systems 
in the ensemble. 
An interaction between the beables of individual systems that make up an ensemble that is described by the quantum state 
may seem a strange and novel idea. But once we regard the members of the ensemble as all physically real, this is just another 
interaction between systems in the universe. Certainly these interactions are highly non-local, but we already know from the 
experimental tests of the Bell inequalities that any theory of beables that reproduces quantum theory must be highly non-local. 
After all, at one time the idea of an interaction between the Sun and the planets seemed bizzare, because it was a non-local action 
at a distance. 
Once one accepts this general idea, the next step is to ask how the dynamics of an individual system can depend on the 
beables of other members of the ensemble in such a way that the predictions of quantum mechanics can be obtained. This 
is accomplished in the next section. We will see that to match the quantum evolution in this picture there must be both a 
stochastic and a continuous evolution rule. There is a stochastic process by which one member of the ensemble can copy the 
beables of another member of the ensemble. This stochastic process realizes an idea that the beables of a system we prepare 
here becomes unpredictably shuffled up with the beables of all the similarly prepared systems in the universe. There is also a 
continuous evolution of the phase beables. Both the stochastic and continuous evolution rules depend on relative frequencies in 
the ensemble. 
One motivation for the copy rule is the idea that space is an emergent property, as suggested by several proposals for quantum 
gravity. If space is emergent. then so is locality. From this perspective, two systems with the same constituents, preparations 
and environment, but only distinguished by their location in space. may be more closely related than is usually thought. Indeed. 
we already know that quantum statistics allows us to give a list of positions where hydrogen atoms in their ground states are to 
be found, but does not permit us to assert which hydrogen atom is in which position. If this extends to the level of the beables, 
then distinct beable configurations may not be stably located with respect to distinct positions in space. The whole ensemble 
of beable states of identical subsystems may then evolve in a way that is not captured by the usual local interactions. The copy 
rule is a simple suggestion for this new kind of interaction, which has a simple realization that reproduces quantum mechanics. 
Other rules might be contemplated, but as we will see the copy rule suffices for our purposes. 
What is nice about the copy rule is that it by itself gives all the dynamics the beables need. Imagine making a series of 
measurements of the beable
of an atom you hold in your laboratory. The first measurement is 00. The second is different, it 
is an. The explanation is not that there was a process by which as evolved to at but that au was copied from another version of 
that atom somewhere in the universe. Evolution occurs because on subsequent observations you will be seeing beables copied 
from the ensemble. This appears to be like motion as a consequence of the rule that gives the probability for the copy process. 
Indeed, we will see in Section V that in an appropriate limit in which h can be ignored this can account for classical motion of 
large bodies. 
In the next section we put the hypotheses we stated above into precise mathematical form and impose several reasonable 
physical assumptions on the evolution rules. In section III we show that a very simple form of the rules then leads to the 
derivation of Schrodinger quantum mechanics. Section IV presents a model for phase alignment. This is a dynamics for the 
phases e4' which has a set of degenerate zero energy solutions that impose both phase alignment and Schrodinger dynamics. 
There are however issues of the stability of these solutions that remain a subject for further work. In section V we raise 
and resolve a question unique to this conception of quantum mechanics, which is whether we can derive the fact that large 
macroscopic bodies obey Newton's laws, while respecting the assertion that their precise microscopic states may be unique, and 
hence not part of a large ensemble. A list of open questions is the substance of section VI. and the conclusions are stated in 
section VII.
