Dear Mr. Epstein, 
I am writing at the suggestion of Julie Taymor. I understand Julie spoke with you at the recent 
WWW Conference about Theatre for a New Audience's Capital Campaign to build the first theatre 
for classic drama since the 1965 Vivian Beaumont in downtown Brooklyn. Julie explained that you 
kindly invited us to send you information about this project. Please find this enclosed. 
Let me give you some background. Julie is on our Board and is the Honorary Co-Chair of the 
Campaign. Founded in 1979, Theatre for a New Audience's cornerstone is Shakespeare and we 
produce Shakespeare alongside other classical and contemporary authors. We're the first 
American theatre to be invited to bring a production of Shakespeare to the Royal Shakespeare 
Company. We've won multiple awards; supported the development of some of our finest artists 
such as Julie who first staged THE TEMPEST and TITUS ANDRONICUS with us. We created and run 
the largest program in the New York City Public Schools to introduce Shakespeare and classic 
drama. Our name refers to how theatre has evolved. The old audience was primarily one 
homogenous group. The new audience is comprised of all ages, cultural and economic back 
grounds. 
Since our founding 33 years ago, we've never had a permanent home. We've always been 
itinerant and dependent on rented spaces which are fast becoming unavailable. In 2000, the City 
invited us to build adjacent to BAM in the Downtown Brooklyn Cultural District -- the first major 
cultural district in New York City since Lincoln Center. Our neighbors will be BAM and Mark 
Morris Dance Center. 650,000 people annually attend BAM alone. Every subway line and the 
LIRR are within a 5-10 minute walk. The New Barclay's Sports and Entertainment Center is a few 
blocks away. 
Our theatre is designed by the eminent architect Hugh Hardy who also designed the interiors of 
Radio City Music Hall and the New Amsterdam. Our design Is inspired by the Cottesloe at 
London's Royal National Theatre. It will be unlike any other New York theatre. It is uniquely 
flexible and works for both classic and contemporary plays. The relationship between the stage 
and the audience can be arranged in almost any configuration. The stage is trapped; the building 
is suspended on acoustic pads to ensure it will be one of the quietest theatres in the City. It has 
seating capacities of 299, 99 and 50. 
Our capital budget is $68.5 million. Despite the economic turmoil of the past decade, we raised 
$52.7 million and broke ground June, 2011. There is nearly $16 million left to raise for essentials 
such as theatrical equipment. Our building is not yet named and is available for a gift in the range 
of $10 to $16 million. It would be a wonderful opportunity for the right individual. Our facility in 
this new cultural district is a thrilling moment in the development of New York theatre and
