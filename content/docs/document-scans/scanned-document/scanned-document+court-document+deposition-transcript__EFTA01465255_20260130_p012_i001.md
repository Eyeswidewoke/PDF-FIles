Transaction for Party B's own account as principal (and not as agent or in 
any other capacity, fiduciary or otherwise). 
(v) Party B has, as of such date, (x) total assets; (y) net worth (for the 
purposes hereof, net worth equals the assets of Party B minus the 
liabilities of Party B as reflected in the most recent financial statements 
of Party B delivered to Party A); and (z) liquid assets at least equal to 
the amounts specified in Appendix II to the Schedule to the Agreement. Party 
B is prepared to bear, and will be capable of bearing (financially and 
otherwise) all risks associated with that Transaction and all other 
Transactions and has sufficient financial wherewithal to incur any loss 
associated with entering into and performing its obligations under that 
Transaction and all other Transactions. See modifications to Appendix II 
[needs to be at low-end, note each trade will be accompanied by an IM 
approval and an understanding of needed collateral, which reduces risk for 
Party A] 
(vi) 
Party B's entrance into this Agreement and that Transaction 
complied and will comply in all respects with all applicable laws, rules, 
regulations, interpretations, guidelines, and governmental and regulatory 
authorities affecting Party B. 
(vii) The financial information of Party B heretofore furnished to Party A 
fairly presents the financial condition of Party B on the dates and for the 
periods covered thereby. As of the date of this Agreement, Party B does not 
have any material liability or contingent obligation not shown on such 
statements. Since the date of such financial information there has been no 
material adverse change in the financial condition, operations, assets, and 
prospects of Party B. 
(e) 
Set Off. Section 6(f) of this Agreement is deleted in its entirety 
and replaced with the following: 
"(f) 
Upon the designation of any Early Termination Date, the party that 
is not the Defaulting Party or Affected Party ("X") may, without prior 
notice to the Defaulting or Affected Party ("Y"), set off any sum or 
obligation (whether or not arising under this Agreement, whether matured or 
unmatured, whether or not contingent and irrespective of the currency, place 
of payment or booking office of the sum or obligation) owed by Y to X or any 
Affiliate of X (the "X Set Off Amount") against any sum or obligation 
(whether or not arising under this Agreement, whether matured or unmatured, 
whether or not contingent and irrespective of the currency, place of payment 
or booking office of the sum or obligation) owed by X or any Affiliate of X 
to Y (the "Y Set Off Amount"). X will give notice to the other party of any 
set off effected under this Section 6(f). 
For this purpose, either the X Set Off Amount or the Y Set Off Amount (or 
the relevant portion of such set off amounts) may be converted by X into the 
currency in which the other set off amount is denominated at the rate of 
exchange at which X would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good 
faith, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency. 
If a sum or obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that 
obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant 
party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained. 
Nothing in this Section 6(f) shall be effective to create a charge or other 
security interest. This Section 6(f) shall be without prejudice and in
