Change 
MR Terms & Conditions ("T&Cs") are changing effective 12/1/2005 to charge an annual fee of $75 to enroll a 
Corporate Card ('CC") in MR, even if it is linked to an MR account with other enrolled charge cards. This 
change applies to CCs enrolled in MR before that date on the next anniversary of such a CC's enrollment 
date that occurs on cr after that date. 
Accacingly: 
Sentence 3, paragraph 1 of the Annual Fees section of the T&Cs is changing to read: 'The annual fee to 
enroll a Corporate Card is $75? The words "$75 annual fee for each Corporate Card and an additional" are 
being deleted from sentence 4, paragraph 1. 
Language in parentheses in sentence 3, paragraph 2 of the Annual Foes section of the T&Cs is chargig to 
read: "(other than the $75 annual fee for Corporate Cads linked to an MR account with other enrolled charge 
cards)".
