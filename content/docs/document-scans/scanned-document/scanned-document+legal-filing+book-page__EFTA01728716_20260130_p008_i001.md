The sex offender using a computer is not a new type of criminal. It is simply a 
matter of modern technology catching up with long-known, well-documented 
behavioral needs. In the past they were probably among the first to obtain and 
use, for their sexual needs, new inventions such as the camera, telephone, auto-
mobile, "instant" camera, and the video camera and recorder. Because of their 
traits and needs, they are willing to spend whatever time, money, and energy it 
takes to obtain, learn about, and use this technology. They are usually among the 
first to obtain and utilize any new technology that fills their needs. 
Organize 
Offenders use computers to organize their collections, correspondence, and 
fantasy material. Many preferential sex offenders in particular seem to be com-
pulsive recordkeepers. A computer makes it much easier to store and retrieve 
names and addresses of victims and individuals with similar interests. Innumer-
able characteristics of victims and sexual acts can be easily recorded and 
analyzed. An extensive pornography collection can be cataloged by subject 
matter. Even fantasy writings and other narrative descriptions can be stored and 
retrieved for future use. Such detailed records can be invaluable in determining 
the ages of children in pornography images, identifying additional victims, iden-
tifying additional subjects, and proving intent. 
One problem the computer creates for law enforcement is determining 
whether computer text describing sexual assaults are fictional stories, sexual fan-
tasies, diaries of past activity, plans for future activity, or current threats. This 
problem can be compounded by the fact that there are individuals who believe 
that cyberspace is a new frontier where the old rules of society should not apply. 
They do not want this "freedom" scrutinized and investigated. For general guid-
ance in evaluating this material, in texts that are just fantasy, everything seems to 
go as planned or scripted with no major problems. Reality rarely works out so 
well. There is, however, no easy solution to this problem. Meticulous analysis, 
documentation, and investigation are the only answers. 
Communicate, Fuel, and Validate 
Many offenders are drawn to online computers to communicate and validate 
their interests and behavior. This validation is actually the most important and 
compelling reason that preferential sex offenders are drawn to the online com-
puter. In addition to physical contact and putting a stamp on a letter or package, 
they can use their computer to exchange information and for validation. Through 
the Internet, national and regional online services, or specialized electronic bulle-
tin boards, offenders can use their computers to locate individuals with similar 
interests. 
The computer may enable them to obtain active validation (i.e., from living 
humans) with less risk of identification or discovery. The great appeal of this type 
of communication is perceived anonymity and immediate feedback. They feel 
protected as when using the mail, but get immediate response as when meeting 
face-to-face. 
Like advertisements in "swinger magazines," computer online services are 
used to identify individuals of mutual interests concerning age, gender, and sexual 
preference. The offender may use an electronic bulletin board to which he has 
authorized access or illegally enter a system. The offender can also setup his own
