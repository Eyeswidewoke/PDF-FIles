Macro Strategy (J. Reid, N. Burns, A. Ip) 
I'll be honest and say that yesterday's EMR was a bit of a daze. I had a belated party for my 40th on 
Saturday and spent virtually the entire Friday night awake with my builders trying to put a house back 
together that has been owned by the builders for 8 months. I had 15 people there until 4am Friday night 
with 3 of them working non-stop until the first guests arrived at 230pm. Never have I been so stressed 
and tired. So all day Sunday and Monday morning were a bit of a daze. Sadly I'm now back living with 
builders again as they finish things off after the party. It was blissful for the few hours we were 
apart. At least we've moved out of the kitchen where we were living and sleeping for nearly 5 months 
before last week. Hopefully by the time the second half of the year ends I'll never have to see a 
builder again. 
Anyway, the second half has now begun for markets and in our H1/02/ June performance review today we 
show that most assets have had a positive year so far. so much so that if the year eventually goes to 
penalties it will end up being a very poor second half showing in line with many of England's in recent 
years!! we briefly review the numbers at the end but all the data and charts are in the pdf of this 
document. Its pretty rare to have almost all main global assets in positive territory this far into a 
year. central bank liquidity continues to drive markets in our opinion which has helped this synchronised 
uplift in valuations. However we can't help sensing that there's less joy over these returns than might 
be expected. Investors are worried about valuations in numerous assets and worried that the Fed might 
become more hawkish soon. There's little chance of the ECB following suit anytime soon though and 
European Government bonds have had a very good 2014 so far. 
Over the last month we've again highlighted how many European Government bond markets have hit multi-
century, all time yield lows. well yesterday it was the turn of the Dutch 10 year yield to go through 
it's all time low again. The Dutch series is where we have our longest history of any government bond 
market with data going back to 1517 spanning almost half a millennia. The graph is in the pdf today and 
further shows just how unique the current situation is. The level of uncertainty about how this all ends 
must by definition be very high given this. 
So as we start H2, Asian markets are trading with a stronger tone this morning helped by a solid start 
to the global manufacturing PMIs. The official Chinese manufacturing PMI printed at 51.0, in line with 
consensus and at a six month high. The final HSBC Chinese manufacturing PMI came in at 50.7, slightly 
below the flash reading of 50.8, but this is also the highest print of the year. The PMIs for other Asian 
bellwethers including Indonesia and Taiwan were also up on a month-to-month basis. The Nikkei (+1.2%) is 
the clear outperformer today, on decent volumes and despite a drop in the Japanese Q2 tankan 
manufacturing index to 12 from 17 previously and 15 expected. The capex component of the Tankan survey 
was above expectations however (+7.4% vs 6.0%) expected, which is strongest rate of growth since 2007. 
This has helped USD)PY (+0.1%) today. Outside of Japan, activity has been subdued with Hong Kong markets 
shut for July 1st holidays. The Indonesian rupiah is poised to
