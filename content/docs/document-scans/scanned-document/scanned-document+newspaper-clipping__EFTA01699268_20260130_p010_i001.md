41 province °Maluku, the push.and pull of multiculture life 
was magnified. During a one-hour bus ride beforehand, our 
guide said, "Visitors are rare, ask destroys the daily life." 
We were met by an enthusiastic crowd of costumed women 
in embroidered white peasant blouses and sarongs. Some had 
arrived hours-earlier from nearby villages to greet us with a 
dance in which they waved scarves and small towels. They wel-
comed us as "sons and daughters of the village." 
A smiling older woman grabbed my arm, and to the accom-
paniment of druths and singing, the crowd danced past tin-
roofed homes to a megalithic ceremonial stone boat in the 
village center. Shouting, shoving, even screaming ensued, and 
cruise passengers were hustled off to the side. 
Seating in the boat is based on status, but it can be con-
tested. A man had taken a position someone else felt was his. 
Government officials moved the arguing men out of view so 
a smaller group could perform a planned ceremony honor-
ing our ship "elders." 
The fight—with yelling and shoving—was the rawest experi-
ence of our cruise. But for the locals, there was a price to be 
paid. A government official threatened to file a report, say-
ing there would be consequences. Our ship withheld bags of 
school supplies, soccer balls, and clean sheets and towels for 
the health clinic, similar to gifts we'd delivered to other villages. 
The donations to'Sangliat Dol returned with us. "We don't 
know when we left the village if they would fight over a soc-
cer ball," Huma said. "We don't want a bad thing to happen." 
No one on the Coral Adventurer, not even the cap-
tain, had sailed the West Papua itinerary before, a route 
designed to mimic a portion. of Dutch explorer Abel Tasman's 
lenders ferry 
pastengers to 
isolated beaches 
along the coast 
voyage roughly 375 years ago. Coral Expeditions, a 35-year-
old company owned since 2O14 by Kallang Capital Holdings 
Pte. of Singapore, is known more for its cruises of Australia 
ICirnberley region and the Great Barrier Reef. 
When you commit to an expedition cruise to a remote 
locale, you can expect long days at sea getting there. Wi-Fi 
connections are sporadic, and there's no satellite TV. Lectures 
are the main shipboard activity. A marine biologist prepared 
us for the world's largest fish, whale sharks—who apparently 
didn't get the memo about our arrival. We looked for them 
without success in Triton Bay in the southwest corner of West 
Papua. The passengers, mostly Australians over-6o, relaxed 
onboard in modern cabins and lounge areas accented with 
African wood and Italian marble. Hot water flowed from 
showers, cappuccinos from coffee machines. Dinner was a 
three-course affair, with Australian wines. 
It was sticky and hot when we explored the tidy dirt streets 
of the Muslim village of Arguni (population 227), in the Fakfak 
regional district. Women, their heads covered, and their 
grandchildren offered warm but cautious smiles. Most of the 
village's adults were as far away as Bali and Jakarta for work 
or study. Although it was Ramadan, women had risen early 
to prepare fish dishes and cakes made of tapioca. 
"You are not tourists anymore, but part of our family;' 
King Hanafi Paus Paus told the crowd. Later, in his small 
house, where the front room is furnished with plastic patio 
chairs and the walls are decorated with photographs of his 
forbears, the king said tourism is improving. Another ship 
had arrived five months ago. Ships have a "good effect," he 
said through a translator. "It protects the history, plus we get 
money. People leave for work, and now work comes to us." 
The king's two sons are in high school in the town of Fakfak 
about 3O miles away. He goes there in his boat, then uses a 
car he keeps in town to get around. 
In all the villages, locals attempted a few words of English, 
and there was a warmth and sincerity to our encounters—even 
if most amounted to us staring at them and them staring at us. 
Ngilngof village, on Kai Kecil Island, provided the welcome 
that felt most linked with the outside world: Women in bright 
purplejackets and long gold skirts danced with delicate hand 
movements as a ritual leader in black raised a coconut, invok-
ing ancestral protection for the island's natural resources. 
Meanwhile, on a 3-mile-long beach with soft, white sand, plas-
tic chairs were s'et up under a tent you could rent for the after-
noon. Snack bars sold cold beers and Diet Cokes. 0
