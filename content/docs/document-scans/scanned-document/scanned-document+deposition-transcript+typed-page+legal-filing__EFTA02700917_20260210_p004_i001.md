with Pope Paul, Cardinal Alberto di Jorio, the President of the Vatican Bank, and Cardinal 
Sergio Guerri, the head of the commission responsible for the administration of the Vatican city-
state. Sindona was then told that although he would be allowed to complete the current 
transactions he was undertaking for the Vatican, he then would have to step aside. 
The man the Pope put in charge of replacing Sindona's Banca Privata Finanziata was Paul 
Marcinkus, a 49-year-old American priest on his staff. He had known Marcinkus since he was a 
young priest, requesting him as an English translator on his trips to America. Standing six foot 
four inches tall, Marcinkus also had acted as the Pope's personal bodyguard. Now the Pope 
appointed him Bishop of Orta, and dispatched him to work under Cardinal Di Jorio at the 
Vatican bank. His real mission was to untangle Sindona's convoluted machination, and find a 
new bank to replace Sindona's. The bank he found was the venerable Banco Ambrosiano, which 
was named after the patron saint of Milan, and located on Via Clerica in Milan. 
The Banco Ambrosiano had been originally founded and owned by priests in Milan in 1896. 
For decades, this bank was headed by Franco Rath, the nephew of Pope Pius XI, and then by 
Duke Gallerati Scotti, a trusted friend of Pope Paul's from Milan. Aside from the personal 
connections, the Vatican owned even then the largest single block of stock in the Banco 
Ambrosiano. Its new chairman, Carlo Canesi, and its general manager, Roberto Calvi, also 
seemed eminently trustworthy. To cement the relationship, the Vatican bank sold the Banco 
Ambrosiano the controlling interest it held in the Banca Cattolica del Veneto, a Venice bank with 
over 100 branches. Aside from the official price of $30 million, the Vatican bank also got a 
secret side payment of $6.2 million. This money was channeled into its subsidiaries in 
Liechtenstein, and used by Calvi to buy for the Vatican enough additional shares in the Banco 
Ambrosiano to give it control of his bank. 
Calvi, the son of a bank clerk, who would succeed Canesi as chairman, consolidated the 
Vatican's anonymous holding companies under a wholly-owned subsidiary in the Bahamas„ 
called the Cisalpine Overseas Bank(Nassau). This entity based in Nassau, and controlled from a 
small office in Monte Carlo, became the center of a dizzying daisy-chain of money transfer and 
borrowing. With the Pope's approval, Marcinkus would become president of the Vatican Bank, 
and serve on the board of this subsidiary in Bahamas. 
Even though Calvi was able to generate huge paper profits for the Vatican in the nineteen-
seventies through sham transactions between the cabal of offshore subsidiaries, he still had a 
problem with Sindona. In November 1977, Sindona, who had been arrested in New York for 
making false statements in his attempt to take over an American bank, demanded that Calvi pay 
him nearly $10 million Sindona claimed he was owed as a "commission." When Calvi refused, 
Sindona carried out a threat to ruin Calvi. 
On November 13, 1977 employees of the Banco Ambrosiano were stunned to find the walls of 
the surrounding buildings of Milan's financial center plastered with giant white, yellow, and blue 
posters revealing in great detail the ultra-secret transactions of the bank. The event, which 
became known in Italy as the day of the "tazebas," or Chinese banners, since the excess of 
colorful posters made the financial district of Milan look like Beijing, had been organized by 
Sindona. Since he had been privy to the secret transfers, the wall posters had revealed the 
numbered accounts in Switzerland through which passed the secret side payments that had been 
used by Calvi and the Vatican bank to get control of the Banco Ambrosiano. In addition, they 
contained three questions, that if correctly answered, would expose the sham transactions 
between the Vatican bank and the Banco Ambrosiano. Calvi ordered the posters to be ripped
