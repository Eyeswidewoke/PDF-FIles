not only the obligor on the loan but also the selling institution. 
Reinvestment Risk. There can be no assurance that, in the event collateral 
prepays or is sold, spreads prevailing at such time will be at the same 
levels as they were when that collateral was purchased. To the extent 
prepaid or sold collateral is reinvested into lower spread assets, the 
interest available to make payments on the Notes may be adversely affected. 
Since senior bank loans generally can be prepaid without penalty and are 
more likely to prepay than bonds, the impact of the foregoing risk factor 
may be heightened with respect to the collateral consisting of senior loans. 
Moreover the average anticipated maturity of senior loans to be acquired may 
be less than the reinvestment period. In the event that holders of the Notes 
are paid principal of their Notes earlier than expected, they may not be 
able to reinvest at the same level of return (or level of risk) that they 
anticipated on the Notes. 
Lender Liability and Equitable Subordination. Because of the nature of the 
Collateral Obligations, the Issuer may be subject to allegations of lender 
liability or claims for equitable subordination if it were determined that 
the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) violated a duty of good 
faith and fair dealing, otherwise engaged in fraud or inequitable conduct or 
committed certain other acts in connection with its dealings with the 
obligor of a Collateral Obligation. Any such claim would materially diminish 
the value of the applicable Collateral Obligation. 
Insolvency Considerations. Various laws enacted for the protection of 
creditors may apply to the Collateral Obligations. If an obligor of a 
Collateral Obligation were to become insolvent, one or more creditors of 
that obligor may claim that the incurrence of the Collateral Obligation was 
a fraudulent conveyance or a preference payment. In either case, if a court 
were to find in favour of such creditor, it could result in a voiding of the 
transaction or a material diminution in the value of the Collateral 
Obligation. 
Fraud. A concern in purchasing Collateral Obligations is the possibility of 
material misrepresentation or omission on the part of the borrower. Such 
inaccuracy or incompleteness may adversely affect the valuation of the 
Collateral Obligations, or may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to 
perfect or effectuate a lien on the collateral securing the Collateral 
Obligations. The Issuer will rely upon the accuracy and completeness of 
representations made by borrowers to the extent reasonable, but cannot 
guarantee such accuracy or completeness. Under certain circumstances in 
connection with a bankruptcy proceeding involving the borrower, payments to 
the Issuer may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later 
determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance or a preferential payment. 
Risk Factors Relating to the Notes 
Subordination. Each class of Notes, other than the Class A Notes will be 
subordinate to each other class of Notes as set forth in the Priority of 
Payments. In addition, each class of Notes will be subordinate to certain
