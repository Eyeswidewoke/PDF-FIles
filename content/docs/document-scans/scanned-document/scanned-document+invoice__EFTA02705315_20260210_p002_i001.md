PROTECT YOUR HEARING! 
We value you as a long-term customer. For 
that reason, we urge you to practice restraint in 
the operation of this product so as not to damage 
your hearing and that of others in your vessel. 
Studies have shown that continuous exposure to 
high sound pressure levels can lead to permanent 
(irreparable) hearing loss. This and all other 
high-power amplifiers are capable of producing 
such high sound pressure levels when connected 
to a speaker system. Please limit your continuous 
exposure to high volume levels. 
While driving, operate your audio system in 
a manner that still allows you to hear necessary 
noises to operate your vessel safely (horns, 
sirens, etc.). 
SERIAL NUMBER 
In the event that your amplifier requires 
service or is ever stolen, you will need to have 
a record of the product's serial number. Please 
take the time to enter that number in the space 
provided below. The serial number can be found 
on the bottom panel of the amplifier and on the 
amplifier packaging.

INSTALLATION APPLICATIONS 
This amplifier is designed for operation in 
vessels with 12 volt, negative-ground electrical 
systems. Use of this product in vessels with 
positive ground and/or voltages ocher than I2V 
may result in damage to the product and will void 
the warranty. 
This product is not certified or approved for 
use in aircraft. 
Do not attempt to 'bridge' the outputs of this 
amplifier with the outputs of a second amplifier, 
including an identical one.

PLANNING YOUR INSTALLATION 
It is important that you take the time to read 
this manual and that you plan out your 
installation carefully. The following are some 
considerations that you must take into account 
when planning your installation. 
Cooling Efficiency Considerations: 
The outer shell of your II. Audio amplifier is 
designed to remove heat from the amplifier 
circuitry. For optimum cooling performance, this 
outer shell should be exposed to as large a volume 
of air as possible. Enclosing the amplifier in a 
small, poorly ventilated chamber can lead to 
excessive heat build-up and degraded 
performance. If an installation calls for an 
enclosure around the amplifier. we recommend 
that this enclosure be ventilated with the aid 
of a fan. In normal applications, fan-cooling 
is not necessary. 
['IMPORTANT
Mounting the amplifier upside down Is 
strongly discouraged. 
Safety Considerations: 
Your amplifier needs to be installed in a dry. 
well ventilated environment and in a manner 
which does not interfere with your vessel's factory 
installed electronic devices. You should also take 
the time to securely mount the amplifier using the 
supplied screws so that it does not come loose in 
the event of a collision or a sudden jolt to the vessel. 
Stupid Mistakes to Avoid: 
• Check before drilling any holes in your vessel to 
make sure that you will not be drilling through 
the hull, a fuel tank, fuel line, wiring harness or 
other vital vessel system. 
• Do not run system wiring outside or underneath 
the vessel. This is an extremely dangerous 
practice which can result in severe damage to 
your vessel and person. 
• Protect all system wires from sharp edges 
(metal, fiberglass, etc.) by carefully routing 
them, tying them down and using grommets 
and loom where appropriate. 
• Do not mount the amplifier in the engine 
compartment or in any other area that will 
expose the amplifier circuitry to the elements. 
IMPORTANT
While this amplifier is specially designed 
for marine applications, it is not waterproof 
and It should not be mounted where it is 
likely to get wet.
