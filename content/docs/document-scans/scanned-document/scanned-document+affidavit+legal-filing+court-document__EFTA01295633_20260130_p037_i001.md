the employees were unaware that the interview was taking place in an adversarial context, 
and that the employees' statements could be used to limit their right to relief'); Longcrier v. 
HL-A Co., 595 F. Supp. 2d 1218, 1228 (S.D. Ala. 2008); Mevorah v. Wells Fargo Home

(N.D. Cal. Nov. 17, 2005). Of course, [I-IN201companies may investigate allegations of 
discrimination and take statements from employees. But when it comes to assessing the 
probative value of those statements -- when weighed against the numerous declarations of 
employees who took the often grave risk of accusing an employer of a workplace violation 
- courts should proceed with eyes open to the imbalance of power and competing 
interests.'D Moreover, as previously observed, the company-obtained affidavits still contain 
numerous allegations of discrimination in promotions decisions - allegations that carry 
significant weight given the circumstances in which they were made. See J.A. 5992-95, 
6143-46, 6174, 6370, 6506, 7036. 
20 The dissent is thus mistaken when it asserts that we are articulating a ("48] new rule that courts categorically may not 
consider the affidavits obtained by companies as part of an investigation irto allegations of discrimination. See post at 141. 
Instead. our analysis concerns the weight that should be given to such affidavits in these circumstances. 
Of course, [HN211 a plaintiff need not "offer evidence that each person for whom it will 
ultimately seek relief was a victim of the employees discriminatory policy." Teamsters, 431 
U.S. at 360; see also EEOC v. Korn Indus., Inc., 662 F.2d 256, 260 (4th Cir. 1981). 
Instead, a bifurcated class action proceeding allows for a "liability" stage to first determine 
whether an employer engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminatory conduct. 
Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 360; Korn, 662 F.2d at 260. Upon a finding of liability, a second 
damages stage allows for the consideration of which individuals were specifically harmed 
by the policy. Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 361; Korn, 662 F.2d at 260.

Here, [HN22] for a liability determination in a disparate treatment claim, the workers' 
statistical and anecdotal evidence, especially when combined, thus provide precisely the 
'glue' of commonality that Wal-Mart demands. See Brown I, 576 F.3d at 156. Such a claim 
requires proof of a "systemwide pattern or practice" of discrimination such that the 
discrimination is "the regular rather than the unusual practice." Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 
336; Cooper, 467 U.S. at 875-76; see also Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552 n.7. The required 
discriminatory r*49] intent may be inferred upon such a showing. See Teamsters, 431 
U.S. at 339-40; r915] Hazelwood, 433 U.S. at 308-09 (observing that "[w]here gross 
statistical disparities can be shown, they alone may in a proper case constitute prima facie 
proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination"). 
Whereas there may have been many answers in Wal-Mart to the question of why any 
individual employee was disfavored, the workers here have sufficiently alleged that there is 
only one answer to the question of why Nucor's black workers were consistently 
disfavored.:' [HN23] Unlike a disparate impact claim, a showing of disparate treatment 
does not require the identification of a specific employment policy responsible for the 
discrimination. See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 336 n.16 (discussing the legislative history of 
Title VII and concluding that the words "pattern or practice" should be interpreted
