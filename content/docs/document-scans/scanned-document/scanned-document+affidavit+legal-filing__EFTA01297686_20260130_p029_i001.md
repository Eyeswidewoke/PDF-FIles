CASE SUMMARY 
PROCEDURAL POSTURE: Plaintiff stockholder. in a representative stockholders' action, applied for 
an injunction to restrain defendant corporation from holding a meeting and allowing the voting of shares 
in favor of a proposed merger or. in the event of approval of the merger by the corporation's stockholders, 
from taking any action designed to effectuate or consummate the merger. 
OVERVIEW: The stockholder, a holder of 750 of the outstanding 590.96() shares of the corporation. 
sought an injunction restraining the corporation, its officers, directors. agents and attorneys from voting 
any shires of stock at a meeting in favor of a proposed merger. In the alternative. the stockholder wanted 
to restrain the corporation from taking any action to effectuate or consummate the merger. The court 
denied the motion. The court slated that it did not need to consider the tint pan of the application 
inasmuch as the meeting of stockholders was not stayed. At that miming. HO percent of the outstanding 
shares were voted in favor of the proposed merger, and two percent of the outstanding shares were voted 
against the proposed merger. The court found that the stockholder did not make out a case which plainly 
showed that the action taken was so far opposed to the true interests of the corporation itself as to lead to 
the clear inference drat na one thus acting could have been influenced by any honest desire to secure such 
interests. The court held that the stockholder failed to meet that test by a wide margin. 
OUTCOME: The court denied the stockholder's motion. 
CORE TERMS: stockholders. bolder, merger. minority stockholders, proxy. outstanding shares. outstanding. stock. 
voted. shares of stock, proposed merger. voting

To warrant the interposition of the court in favor of the minority stockholders in a corporation or 
joint-stock association, as against the contemplated action of the majority, where such action is 
within the corporate powers, a arse must be made out which plainly shows that such action is so far 
opposed to the true interests of the corporation itself as to lead to the clear inference that no one thus 
acting could have been influenced by any honest desire to secure such interests, but that he must have 
acted with an intent to subserve some outside purpose. regardless of the consequences to the 
company and in a manner inconsistent with its interests.
