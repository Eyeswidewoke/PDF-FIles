CFTC Initial Margin Segregation Fact Sheet 
April 2014 
1. What are the CFTC Initial Margin Segregation Regulations? 
In November 2013, the CFTC published final rules requiring swap dealers and 
major swap participants to notify counterparties of their right to require 
segregation of initial margin ("IM") for uncleared swap transactions® 
The notification must be made to an officer (your "collateral contact") 
responsible for the management of collateral. If no such officer is 
identified by the counterparty, the notification is to be made to the Chief 
Risk Officer of the counterparty, or, if there is no such officer, to the 
Chief Executive Officer. If no Chief Executive Officer exists, the notice 
may be given to the highest level decision-maker for the counterpart 
The swap dealer and major swap participant must obtain the counterparty's 
confirmation of receipt by the collateral contact for such notificatior1 
The swap dealer and major swap participant must obtain the counterparty's 
election about whether or not the counterparty requires segregation of IM in 
accordance with the rule® 
2. Why am I receiving this notification? 
You have been identified as a counterparty who may post IM to Deutsche Bank 
AG ("DB") with respect to uncleared swap transactions. Please note the 
regulation applies to each such counterparty at the legal entity 
counterparty level (e.g., fund or managed account level) 
3. What is the compliance date? 
May 5, 2014, if no agreement (e.g., an ISDA Master Agreement) existed 
between the counterparty and DB concerning uncleared swap transactions as of 
January 6, 2014 ("new counterparties")® 
November 3, 2014, if an agreement did exist between the counterparty and DB 
concerning uncleared swap transactions as of January 6, 2014 (existing 
counterparties") 
4. What right does the regulation give to counterparties that post IM? 
The right to have IM segregated with a third-party custodian. This right is 
only with respect to uncleared swap transactions entered into on or after 
the relevant compliance date (May 5, 2014 for new counterparties and 
November 3, 2014 for existing counterparties) 
5. Which custodians may hold the segregated IM? 
The regulation requires DB to identify one or more acceptable custodians, 
one of which must be a creditworthy non-affiliate and each of which must be 
a legal entity independent of DB and the counterpartYD. DB is identifying 
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (the 
swap dealer) and State Street and Trust Company, as acceptable custodians 
6. What is the cost of segregation? 
The regulation requires DB to provide its counterparties with information 
regarding the price of segregation for each identified custodian, to the 
extent that DB has such information!". Any pricing information provided will 
be for informational purposes only, and may be subject to change. If you 
elect to require segregation, you will need to negotiate and execute a 
definitive agreement with a custodian acceptable to yourself and DB 
DB would expect any custodial fees, charges or costs related to IM 
segregation to be borne by our counterparty 
7. What actions do counterparties need to perform? 
First, you will receive a notice requesting the identity of, and contact
