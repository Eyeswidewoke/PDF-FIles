Some minor edits 
II am sure lam not the only person who has worked hard all his life, ensured that his family is well cared for while he is 
alive and after his death, and entrusted his own personal financial affairs to a trust and estate lawyer, expecting to 
spend his final years without concerns about these matters. I will relate my own experiences with my former lawyer, A. 
Max Kohlenberg, a partner of the firm Howland Evangelista Kohlenberg, LIP. Perhaps these experiences may provide a 
lesson for others. 
When my first wife died in 2008, I was 80 years old. I knew that my children and grandchildren were well cared for, with 
trusts and other investments that I had already set up for them, and with valuable property that had been transferred 
them. After my first wife's death, having no financial expertise and no wish to pay attention to my personal financial 
affairs, I retained an estate lawyer. I assumed that it would not be problematic, having been a full professor at MIT for 
many years, with investments in a pension account . I entrusted my affairs completely to Mr. Kohlenberg and to an 
investment firm 
(Bainco) with which he had close connections. I resigned from my position as trustee of a Marital Trust that my first wife 
and I had set up earlier with the intention that it be available to the survivor of the two of us, and would then pass on to 
our children after the survivor's death. I asked my son Harry to replace me as trustee, along with Mr. Kohlenberg as co-
trustee. 
In 2014 I remarried and accordingly began to think about a new future. I was greatly distressed to find out that I faced 
serious financial problems. I learned that my only stable sole source of income was an IRA, which was being depleted by 
distributions to family along with taxes and management fees for the whole estate, encompassing the entire mandatory 
withdrawal. Sometimes it appears 
without my express written consent. Therefore, even for ordinary 
personal expenses, I had to make additional withdrawals, with a tax penalty. 
The Marital Trust was supposed to be paying an annual income to me. 
Recently, independent financial advisers have informed me that the trustees had put me in long-term partnership 
investments, and that in general the investments of the Trust were designed in ways that would reduce income to me —
even if I received an amount over the fees be=ng charged — leaving the Trust larger at my death. My home in the 
suburbs and a summer cottage that I owned had been already been transferred to my children. 
My second wife and I realized that at age 86, it was advisable to move to an apartment in town with no steps, no snow 
removal and other such concerns, and no long commute to my office at MIT. That of course increased expenses since I 
had been living rent free and was surprised that the structure also dictated that I receive no money from the sale 
of my house. 
To pay my income tax, I had no alternative but to access at double taxation money from my IRA account. My first 
requests for tax relief from the Marital Trust were denied by the two trustees, my son Harry and Mr. Kohlenberg, unless 
I agreed to submit to a detailed and highly intrusive examination of my private expenses, life style, etc., demands that 
were simply humiliating and which I of course rejected. 
I also requested information from Mr. Kohlenberg about what had been happening with the Marital Trust. Most 
requests went unanswered.
