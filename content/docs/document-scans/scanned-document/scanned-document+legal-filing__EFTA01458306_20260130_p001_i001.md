Wash" investigation). Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe that the economy will 
recover if the government returns to the same populist policies that were mainly responsible 
for the crisis in the first place. In the absence of a comprehensive fiscal adjustment and 
without a significant economic recovery, the risk is that Brazil might have to generate 
increasing inflation rates to cope with its ballooning public debt, a perverse process that 
we all remember very well from the1980s. 
In light of the latest developments, we are updating our macroeconomic forecasts to take into 
consideration the higher risks. While our scenario is not one of uncontrolled inflation, it 
envisages a much slower economic recovery, weaker exchange rate, and higher inflation. We are 
optimistically assuming that, despite the latest setbacks, the government will manage to 
obtain a minimum support from Congress to at least avoid another consolidated primary fiscal 
deficit in 2016 (most likely through higher taxes), gaining time to slowly work on structural 
measures that could produce better fiscal results in the coming years. In our scenario, we 
assume that President Dilma Rousseff will complete her second mandate, but we expect Brazil 
to lose its investment grade status in 1Q16. That said, the scenario remains quite volatile 
due to high political uncertainty reflecting Rousseff's lack of support in Congress, the "Car 
Wash" investigation and the economic crisis. Therefore, the risk remains on the downside, as 
the government could fail to obtain political support to minimally shore up the fiscal 
accounts, leading to greater financial and economic instability. 
We cut our 2015 GDP forecast to -2.8% from -2.3%, and our 2016 GDP forecast to -0.5% from -
0.2%. We expect fixed-asset investment to plunge roughly 11% this year, and the external 
sector's positive contribution will prevent a larger economic contraction. We raised our 2015 
IPCA consumer price index forecast slightly to 9.4% from 9.3%, and our 2016 IPCA projection 
to 5.9% from 5.4% (mainly due to the weaker FX). We now expect the BRL to finish 2015 at 
BRL3.70/USD, and 2016 at BRL3.90/USD (instead of BRL3.40/USD and BRL3.65/USD, respectively). 
Despite the higher inflation, we continue to expect the BCB to cut the SELIC rate to 11.50% 
in 2016 (with the easing cycle still beginning in April), as we expect the authorities to 
throw in the towel and postpone convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target again (although 
we still do not see inflation at 4.5% in 2017). The silver lining is that the deeper 
recession and weaker FX will produce a larger adjustment in the external accounts: we cut our 
current account deficit forecast to USD70.0bn from USD76bn for 2015, and to USD63bn from 
USD76bn for 2016.
