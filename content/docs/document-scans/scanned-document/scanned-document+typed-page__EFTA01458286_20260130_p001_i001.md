Special Report: The 'Great Accumulation' Is Over: FX Reserves Have Peaked. Beware 01 
The different shades of reserve accumulation 
In this first section, we differentiate the main reserve holders into four analytical 
clusters to identify the drivers. We then distill these drivers into a simple top-down 
model of global FX reserves to project the trajectory in the near future. The last 
section resumes the cluster approach in discussing structural changes and the 
longer-term outlook. The FX implications are flagged throughout the analysis. 
Asia accounts for more than half of global central bank reserves, making the region 
the biggest swing factor in anticipating how reserve trends will evolve. China alone 
accounts for 30% of global reserves, while Taiwan, Korea, India, Hong Kong, 
Singapore, and Thailand also rank among the Top 15 reserve holders (Figures 1 
and 2). DM central banks hold a third of global reserves, with Japan and 
Switzerland the key accumulators over the past decade and a half. Large oil 
exporters account for 10% of central bank reserves, with Saudi Arabia and Russia 
the main contributors. Other large oil exporters like Qatar or the UAE, which are 
also believed to have significant investable FX funds, hold them mostly unreported 
in sovereign wealth funds (SVVF). Non-Asia EM accounts for another tenth with 
Brazil, Mexico and Turkey having the deepest pockets. Lately, we have started to 
see reserves fall in China and oil-producing nations, while growth has flattened 
out in the other country groups (Figure 3). 
Our starting point in forecasting reserve developments is to identify the 
sources of reserves built up in the past fifteen years. Governments typically 
accumulate reserves for two objectives. The 'mercantilist' objective is to 
preserve a developing economy's surpluses with a view to optimizing the 
investment of these savings, not least inter-generationally. Typically, such 
reserves originate in large current account surpluses, often inflated by 
commodity windfalls, and are most likely to be held in SWFs, China being the 
main exception. 
The second objective is to hold reserves as a precautionary buffer against 
excessive currency volatility or sudden capital stops. Central banks guard 
economies against potentially flighty 'hot money' by absorbing capital inflows. 
Foreign liabilities pose particular risks if they are of shorter maturity than 
foreign assets or denominated in foreign currency. Such mismatches 
characterized many national balance sheets in the early stages of EM catch-up 
growth and had dire consequences during the debt and currency crises of the 
late 1990s.
