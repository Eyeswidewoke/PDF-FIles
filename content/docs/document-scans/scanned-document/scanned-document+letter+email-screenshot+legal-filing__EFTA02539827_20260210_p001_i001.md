Brief Academic Biography of Marvin Minsky 
Marvin Minsky is Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at the Massach=setts Institute of Technology. His 
research has led to both theoretical and=practical advances in artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, 
neural=networks, and the general theory of computation. (In 1961 he showed that a=y computer can be simulated by a 
machine with only two registers and two si=ple instructions.) He has made many other contributions in the domains of 
c=mputer graphics, symbolic computation, knowledge representation, commonsens=cal semantics, and both symbolic 
and connectionist learning. He has also be=n involved with advanced technologies for exploring space. 
Professor Minsky was also a pioneer of robotics and telepresence. He designe= and built some of the first visual 
scanners, and mechanical hands with tac=ile sensors, along with their software and hardware interfaces. These 
influ=nced many subsequent robotic projects. 
In 1951 he built the first randomly wired neural network learning -- based o= reinforcing the synaptic connections that 
contributed to recent reactions.=ln 1956, when a Junior Fellow at Harvard, he invented and built the first C=nfocal 
Scanning Microscope, an optical instrument with unprecedented resolu=ion and image quality. 
Since the early 1950s, Marvin Minsky has worked on using computational ideas=to characterize human psychological 
processes, as well as working to endow m=chines with intelligence. His 1961 paper, "Steps Towards Artificial 
Intelli=ence" surveyed and analyzed what had been done before, and outlined many ma=or problems that the infant 
discipline would later later need to face. The 1=63 paper, "Matter, Mind, and Models" addressed the problem of making 
self-a=are machines. In "Perceptrons," 1969, Minsky and Seymour Papert characteriz=d the capabilities and limitations 
of loop-free learning and pattern recogn=tion machines. In "A Framework for Representing Knowledge" (1974) Minsky 
pu= forth a model of knowledge representation to account for many phenomena in=cognition, language understanding, 
and visual perception. These representat=ons, called "frames," inherited their variable assignments from previously 
d=fined frames, and are often considered to be an early form of object orient=d programming. 
In the early 1970s, Minsky and Papert began formulating a theory which combi=ed insights from developmental child 
psychology and their experience with r=search on Artificial Intelligence — a view in which human intellige=ce comes 
from the managed interaction of a diverse variety of agencies. The= argued that such diversity is necessary because 
different tasks require fu=damentally different mechanisms; this transforms psychology from a fruitles= quest for a few 
"basic" principles into a search for mechanisms that a min= could use to manage the interaction of many diverse 
elements. 
Bits and pieces of this theory emerged in papers through the 70s and early 8=s. Papert turned to applying these new 
ideas to transforming education whil= Minsky continued to work on "The Society of Mind," a book published in 198= 
which 270 interconnected one-page ideas reflect the structure of the theor= itself. Each page either proposes one such 
mechanism to account for some p=ychological phenomena or addresses a problem introduced by some proposed 
so=ution of another page. In 2006, Minsky published a sequel, "The Emotion Mac=ine," which proposes theories that 
could account for human higher-level fee=ings, goals, emotions, and conscious thoughts in terms of multiple levels o=
