GIVIG300/G400 PILOT TRAINING MANUAL 
Air Cycle Machine 
lie air cycle machine (ACM) is an expansion 
pansion 
turbine which reduces 
temperature by 
the air to perform useful work, and so causes 
a pressure and temperature drop. The work 
extracted from the airstream in the turbine 
section is absorbed by operating a compres-
sor wheel, which is directly shafted to the tur-
bine wheel, located in a separate chamber o 
the upstream side of the unit. A large percent-
age of the work 
extractedthe 
from the airstream 
by the turbine is used by 
compressor wheel. 
As the compressor wheel is performing 
work 
on the upstream air, its pressure and temper-
ature are increased. This is called the bootstrap 
principle, which is actually a pressure recov-
ery system used in modern air cycle systems. 
Secondary Heat Exchangers 
Heat exchangers are installed adjacent to the 
primary heat exchangers in the tail compart-
ment. These heat exchangers also use ram air 
from the dorsal fin ram-air inlet as a coolant. 
Water Separator System 
Expansion through the cooling turbine reduces 
discharge temperatures below ambient tem-
peratures and forces moisture in the air to 
condense. 
Water Separators 
The water separators provide a mechanical 
means of water removal and consist of two sec-
tions: the inlet section is a coalescer and makes 
a few large drops from many small droplets by 
passing the droplet-laden airstream through a 
coarse mesh cloth bag while the second section 
accomplishes the actual water removal. 
Water extracted from the air is also sprayed 
into the secondary heat exchanger cooling air 
inlet to assist in cooling.

Water Separator Anti-ice 
System 
On a cool, moist day cooling turbine dischar$e 
temperatures fall low enough that water is it 
only condensed but freezes. To prevent the bat
of the water separator from becoming clog$ed
with ice crystals and restricting the airflow, a
water separator anti-ice system is installed. 
Water Separator Anti-ice Valve 
This valve is a butterfly-type shutoff and mod. 
ulating valve. The unit controls the ranger. 
ation unit cold air outlet temperature to a 
minimum of 37°F (nominal) by modulating the 
flow of compressor inlet air to the anti-ice 
muff at the turbine discharge. 
Water Separator Anti-ice 
Sensor 
The water separator anti-ice sensor is a nook
m atm thermostat, installed on the discharge
side of the water separator. This thermostat 
set
 is 
to maintain the valve position so that the
air moving through the water separator

is held 
at a temperature of

The system design is such that maximum in.
