commencement of such Flight Test or, if arising out of a condition or circumstance occurring 
during said Flight Test, as may be requested by Purchaser and agreed to by Seller during said

Limit.

designate Escrow Agent as Seller's and Purchaser's Professional User Entity for purposes of 
requesting and providing consent to the registration of a searchable Contract of Sale (Bill of 
Sale) evidencing the transfer of title to the Aircraft from Seller to Purchaser.
