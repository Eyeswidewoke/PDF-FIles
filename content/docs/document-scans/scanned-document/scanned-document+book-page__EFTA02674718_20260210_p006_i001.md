FTD cases. GRN is involved in cell cycle progres-
sion, growth control, wound healing and in many 
other biological processes. It also displays abundant 
expression in the brain. By comparison, MAPT binds 
and stabilizes microtubules and plays an important 
role in neuronal polarity and signal transduction. 
Hyperphosphorylation of tau may be also associated 
with schizophrenia, and it has been suggested that 
dysregulation of reelin contributes to hyperphospho-
rylation of tau in schizophrenia (Deutsch et al., 
2006). Thus, tau pathology may be associated with 
both FTD and schizophrenia, and reelin may be one 
of the regulators of tau function. Future studies are 
needed, however, to test these hypotheses. 
Magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown 
strikingly asymmetric atrophy in brains of FTD 
patients, particularly in the GREY carriers (Beck 
et al., 2008; Rohrer et al., 2011; Whitwell et al., 
2012). This asymmetry is often detected in the fron-
tal, temporal and parietal regions. Moreover, the rate 
of atrophy in the left hemisphere is higher than that 
in the right (Rohrer et al., 2012). However, FTD 
patients carrying MAPT mutations normally don't 
show asymmetric atrophy (Rohrer & Warren, 2011). 
These studies suggest an association of specific FTD 
gene mutations with asymmetric atrophy during dis-
ease progression. 
Intriguing questions then arise, whether genes 
mutated in FTD and/or schizophrenia are asym-
metrically expressed in the normal human brain, and 
whether their mutations are associated with abnor-
mal brain laterality and pathogenesis of FTD and 
schizophrenia. Previous studies have shown that cer-
tain genes are asymmetrically expressed in human 
foetal brains (Sun et al., 2005, Sun & Walsh, 2006). 
Among these genes, MAPT has higher expression 
levels in the left than in the right hemisphere (more 
than two-fold) in human foetal 14-week-old brains 
(Sun et al., 2005). In human embryonic 10-week-old 
brains Reelin is also more highly expressed in the left 
than in the right hemisphere (about 1.6-fold) (t 
Sun, unpublished data). Although a larger sample 
size is required to draw a comprehensive gene expres-
sion profile, these studies suggest that at least Reelin 
and MAPT may participate in the process of estab-
lishing normal brain laterality. Mutations of Reelin 
and MAP7'may disrupt normal asymmetry and con-
tribute to the pathology of FTD and schizophrenia. 
It is yet to be understood why FTD patients with 
MAPT mutations mostly show symmetric brain atro-
phy patterns, whereas patients with GRN mutations 
show asymmetric atrophy in the brain. Nevertheless, 
investigating the molecular regulation of brain asym-
metry will likely provide insights into the aetiology 
of FM and schizophrenia. 
Interestingly, Snowden et al. (2012) have recently 
noted that psychosis in patients with FTD is strongly 
Schizophrenia and FTD 
173 
associated with a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in 
C9ORF72 gene, a mutation found in approximately 
6% of sporadic, and 25% of familial cases with amy-
otrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; a very common form 
of MND) and FTD (Rademakers, 2012). In fact, the 
presence of psychosis increased the odds of having 
the C9ORF72 gene mutation by 15-fold. Thus, it is 
possible that mutation in the C9ORF72 gene may be 
a major cause not only of FTD and MND (Dejesus-
Hernandez a al., 2011; Renton et at, 2011), but also 
of late onset psychosis (Ferrari et al., 2012; Murray 
et al., 2011). Of note, aside from FTD-MND, a 
relatively high prevalence of psychosis has been noted 
in rare cases with fused-in-sarcoma (FUS), a pathol-
ogy also associated with MND (Seelaar et al., 2010; 
Snowden et al., 2011). However, despite the above, 
there is a phenotypic variability in regard to the 
C9ORF72 repeat expansions. For example, cases 
with behavioural variant FTD without MND as well 
as PPAs without psychosis have been documented 
(Renton a al., 2011; Snowden et al., 2012).The neu-
ropathology may be also heterogeneous (Murray 
et al., 2011; Snowden, 2012). Further, in a recent 
study, Huey et al. (2012) screened DNA samples 
from a large cohort of unrelated subjects with schizo-
phrenia for mutation in the C9ORF72 gene. Interest-
ingly, none of these subjects had the C9ORF72 
repeat expansions, suggesting this mutation is unlikely 
to cause schizophrenia. Thus, caution needs to be 
exercised when determining the association between 
mutation in C9ORF72 gene, FTD phenotype, the 
presence of psychosis, and schizophrenia. 
Shared causation and future research 
directions 
The possibility of a shared causation between schizo-
phrenia and certain dementias has been raised before 
(DeLisi, 2008; Schoder, 2010). The present review 
provides additional rationale for pursuing this line of 
research further. Such future research will emphasize 
both genetic and cognitive parallels between certain 
forms of schizophrenia and FTD in a synergistic, 
coordinated way. It is also increasingly possible to 
envision genetic research provide incrementally pre-
cise answers to the following questions: 
1. Are the genes particularly strongly expressed in 
the two regions most commonly implicated in 
FTD and schizophrenia - orbitofrontal cortex 
and anterior temporal regions - characterized by 
asymmetric expression? 
2. Are some of such asymmetrically expressed 
genes the same in the orbitofrontal cortex and 
the anterior temporal regions? 
3. Are some of these genes implicated both in schiz-
ophrenia and in FTD?
