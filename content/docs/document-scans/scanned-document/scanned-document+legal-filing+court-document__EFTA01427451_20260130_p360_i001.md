Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
corporation. Where an officer or director is successful on the merits or 
otherwise in the defense of any action referred to above, the corporation 
must indemnify him against the expenses which such officer or director has 
actually and reasonably incurred. 
Section 145 further authorizes a corporation to purchase and maintain 
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, 
employee or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of 
the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another 
corporation or enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and 
incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as 
such, whether or not the corporation would otherwise have the power to 
indemnify him or her under Section 145. 
Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that we must indemnify our 
directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the 
DGCL and must also pay expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in 
advance of its final disposition upon delivery of an undertaking, 
by or on behalf of an indemnified person, to repay all amounts so advanced 
if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to 
be indemnified under this section or otherwise. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, we shall not be obligated to indemnify a director or officer in 
respect of a proceeding (or part thereof) instituted by such director or 
officer, unless such proceeding (or part thereof) has been authorized by the 
Board of Directors pursuant to the applicable procedure outlined in the 
amended and restated bylaws. 
Section 174 of the DGCL provides, among other things, that a director, who 
willfully or negligently approves of an unlawful payment of 
dividends or an unlawful stock purchase or redemption, may be held jointly 
and severally liable for such actions. A director who was either absent 
when the unlawful actions were approved or dissented at the time may avoid 
liability by causing his or her dissent to such actions to be entered in 
the books containing the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors 
at the time such action occurred or immediately after such absent director 
receives notice of the unlawful acts. 
The indemnification rights set forth above shall not be exclusive of any 
other right which an indemnified person may have or hereafter 
acquire under any statute, provision of our amended and restated certificate 
of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, agreement, vote of 
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 
We expect to maintain standard policies of insurance that provide coverage 
(1) to our directors and officers against loss rising from 
claims made by reason of breach of duty or other wrongful act and (2) to us 
with respect to indemnification payments that we may make to such 
directors and officers. 
The proposed form of Underwriting Agreement to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 to 
this Registration Statement provides for indemnification to 
us, our directors and officers and the selling stockholders by the 
underwriters, and to the underwriters by us and the selling stockholders, 
against 
certain liabilities.
