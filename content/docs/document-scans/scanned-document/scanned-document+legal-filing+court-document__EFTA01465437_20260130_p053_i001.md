DBSI, at its discretion, to request and obtain extension(s) of Client's time 
to make payment for securities Client purchased, as provided for by 
Federal Reserve Bank Regulation T. 
4. Liens 
Client hereby grants to DBSI and its Affiliates a security interest in and 
lien upon all Securities and Other Property in the possession or control of 
DBSI, any of its Affiliates or Pershing, in which Client has an interest 
(held individually, jointly or othero/ise) (collectively all such Securities 
and 
Other Property are referred to herein as "Collatera") in order to secure any 
and all indebtedness or any other obligation of Client to DBSI and its 
Affiliates or Pershing (provided that such indebtedness or obligation to 
Pershing arises in connection with this Agreement) (collectively, all such 
obligations ere referred to herein as the "Obligations"). Clients who are 
joint accountholders ("Joint Accountholders") acknowledge and agree that 
pursuant to this lien, the Collateral shall include Securities and Other 
Property held in the Account or any other account held by either Joint 
Accountholder with DBSI or its Affiliates (whether individually, jointly or 
otherwise) and shall secure any and all Obligations of each Joint 
Accountholder to DBSI and its Affiliates. DBSI (or Pershing, at DBSI's 
instruction) may, at any time and without prior notice, sell, transfer, 
release, 
exchange, settle or othen/vise dispose of or deal with any or all such 
Collateral in order to satisfy any Obligations. In enforcing this lien, DBSI 
shall 
have the discretion to determine which Securities and Other Property to 
apply for the purposes of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
nothing herein shall be deemed to grant an interest in any Account or assets 
that would give rise to a prohibited transaction under Section 4975(c) 
(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section 406(a)(i)-
(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as 
amended. Securities and Other Property held in Client's retirement 
account(s) maintained by DBSI, which may include IRAs or qualified plans, are 
not subject to this lien and such Securities and Other Property may only be 
used to satisfy Client's indebtedness or other obligations related to 
Client's retirement account(s). 
5. Authority to Borrow 
In case of the sale of any security or other property by DBSI at Client's 
direction and DBSI's inability to timely deliver the same to the purchaser by 
reason of Client's failure to supply DBSI therewith. Client authorizes DBSI 
to purchase or borrow any security or other property necessary to make 
the required delivery, and Client agrees to be responsible for any loss or 
cost, including interest, which DBSI sustains as a result of Client's failure 
to make delivery to DBSI. 
6. Interest Charges 
Client acknowledges that debit balances in the Account, including, but not 
limited to, those arising from its failure to make payment by settlement 
date for securities purchased, will be charged interest at the then current 
rate, in accordance with DBSI's usual custom. Interest will be computed 
on the net daily debit balance, which is computed by combining all debit 
balances and credit balances in each account with the exception of 
EFTA01465489
