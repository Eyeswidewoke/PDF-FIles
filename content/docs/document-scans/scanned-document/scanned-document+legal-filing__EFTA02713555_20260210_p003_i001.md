Interest/dividend payments on certain preferred issues may be deferred by the issuer for periods of tip to 5 to IC years, depending on the particular issue. The investor would still have income tax liability even though 
payments would not have been received. The majority of preferred securities arc "callable" meaning that the issuer may retire the securities at specific prices and dates prior to maturity. Price quoted is per 51.000 share, 
unless otherwise specified. Current yield is calculated by multiplying the coupon by par value divided by the market price. Some Preferred securities arc QDI (Qualified Dividend Income) eligible. Information on QD1 
eligibility is obtained from third party sources. The dividend income on QDI eligible preferreds qualifies fora reduced tax rate. In order to qualify for the preferential tax treatment all qualifying preferred securities must be 
held fora minimum period • 91 days during a IRO day window period, beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date. The initial rate on a floating rate or index•linked preferred security may be lower than that of a fixed-rate 
security of the same maturity because investors expect to receive additional income due to future increases in the floating/linked index. However, there can be no assurance that these increases will occur. Securities rated 
below investment grade may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market. Investors should carefully 
consider these risks in relation to their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high yield products. High yield securities should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio. 
The initial interest rate on a floating or index-linked floating rate note may be lower than that of a fixed-rate note of the same maturity because investors expect to receive additional income due to future increases in the 
linked index, e.g. CPI, LIBOR etc. However, there can be no assurances that these increases will occur. 
Bonds rated below investment grade may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of investment grade securities, including greater credit risk, price volatility and limited liquidity in the 
secondary market. Investors should carefully consider these risks in relation to their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high yield products. High yield bonds should comprise only a 
limited portion of a balanced portfolio.
