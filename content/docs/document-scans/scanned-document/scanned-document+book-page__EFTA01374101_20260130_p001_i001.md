AGP LP 519 Alpha Group Caudal Paul Barren 
Non-U.S. Securities 
Investing in securities of non-U.S. governments and companies which are generally denominated 
in non-U.S. currencies and utilization of options on non-U.S. securities involves certain considerations 
comprising both risks and opportunities not typically associated with investing in securities of the United 
States Government or United States companies. These considerations include changes in exchange rates 
and exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, 
less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher 
transaction costs, less governmental supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, greater risks 
associated with counterparties and settlement, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform 
accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. 
Emerging Markets 
Investing in developing market debt or equity involves certain heightened risks and special 
considerations not typically associated with investing in other more established economies or securities 
markets. Such risks may include () increased risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets or 
confiscatory taxation; (i) greater social, economic and political uncertainty including war; (ii) higher 
dependence on exports and the corresponding importance of international trade; (iv) greater volatility, less 
liquidity and smaller capitalization of securities markets; (v) greater volatility in currency exchange rates; 
(v) greater risk of inflation; (vi) greater controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of 
invested capital and on the Partnership's ability to exchange local currencies for U.S. dollars; 
(vii) increased likelihood of governmental involvement in and control over the economies; 
(ix) governmental decisions to discontinue support of economic reform programs generally and to impose 
centrally planned economies; (x) differences in auditing and financial reporting standards that may result in 
the unavailability of material information about issuers; (xi) less extensive regulation of the securities 
markets; (xi) longer settlement periods for securities transactions and less reliable clearance and custody 
arrangements; (xiii) less developed corporate laws regarding fiduciary duties of officers and directors and 
the protection of investors; (xiv) higher transaction costs; (xv) imposition of foreign taxes; (xvi) difficulty in 
enforcing contractual obligations; (xvi) less available information than is generally the case in the United 
States; and (xviii) certain considerations regarding the maintenance of Partnership securities and cash with 
non-U.S. brokers and securities depositories. 
Currency Risks 
The Partnership's investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are 
subject to the risk that the value of the particular currency will change in relation to one or more other 
currencies. As a result, the Partnership could realize a net loss on an investment, even if there were a gain 
on the underlying investment before currency losses were taken into account. Among the factors that may 
affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative 
values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital 
appreciation and political developments. The Investment Manager may seek to hedge these risks by 
investing in currencies, currency futures contracts and options on currency futures contracts, forward 
currency contracts, swaps, swaptions, or any combination thereof (whether or not exchange traded), but 
there can be no assurance that such strategies will be effective. 
Short Sales 
Short sales can, in certain circumstances, substantially increase the impact of adverse price 
movements on the Partnership's portfolio. A short sale involves the risk of a theoretically unlimited increase 
in the market price of the particular investment sold short, which could result in an inability to cover the short 
position and a theoretically unlimited loss. There is the risk that the securities borrowed by the Partnership 
in connection with a short sale must be retumed to the securities lender on short notice. If a request for 
return of borrowed securities occurs at a time when other short sellers of the security are receiving similar 
requests, a 'short squeeze can occur, and the Partnership may be compelled to replace borrowed 
securities previously sold short with purchases on the open market at the most disadvantageous time, 
possibly at prices significantly in excess of the proceeds received in originally selling the securities short.
