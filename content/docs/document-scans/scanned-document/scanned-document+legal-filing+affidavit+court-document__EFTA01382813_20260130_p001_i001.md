FIRST DATA CORPORATION 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
The Company employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets with proper consideration 
of diversification and re-balancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed-income 
securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over 
the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. 
Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to chock for reasonableness and appropriateness. All assumptions are the responsibility of 
management. 
Plan assets The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used 
to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan 
liabilities and plan funded status. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, 
equity investments are diversified across U.S. and global equity investments. In addition, private equity securities comprise a very small part of the 
equity allocation. The fixed income allocation is a combination of fixed income investment strategics designed to contribute to the total rate of 
return of all plan assets while minimizing risk and supporting the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's pension plan target allocation for the 
U.S. plans based on the investment policy as of December 31, 2014 was 40% equity securities and 60% debt securities. 
Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability 
measurements, and periodic asset and liability studies. The general philosophy of the Benefit Committee in setting the allocation percentages for 
the domestic plan is to adhere to the appropriate allocation mix necessary• to support the underlying plan liabilities as influenced significantly by the 
demographics of the participants and the frozen nature of the plan. 
The goal of the Board of Trustees of the United Kingdom plan is the acquisition of secure assets of appropriate liquidity, which are 
expected to generate income and capital growth to meet, together with new contributions from the Company, the cost of current and future benefits, 
as set out in the Trust Deed and Rules. The Trustees, together with the plan's consultants and actuaries, further design the asset allocation to limit 
the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities over the long term. The Truster approach to the investment strategy is to allocate the assets into 
two pools: 1) Off-risk assets whereby the focus is risk management, protection. and insurance relative to the liability target invested in. but not 
limited to, debt, United Kingdom government bonds, and United Kingdom government index-linked bonds: and 2) On-risk assets whereby the 
focus is on retum generation and taking risk in a controlled manner. Such assets could include equities. government bonds, high-yield bonds, 
property. commodities, or hedge funds. The target allocation for this plan is 40% off-risk assets and 60% on-risk assts.
