securities traded on these foreign markets are less liquid and their prices more volatile than 
securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, settlement of trades in some non-U.S. 
markets is much slower and more subject to failure than in U.S. markets. There also may be less 
extensive regulation of the securities markets in particular countries than in the U.S. 
Additional costs could be incurred in connection with the Partnership's international 
investment activities. Foreign brokerage commissions and trading costs are generally higher 
than in the U.S. Expenses also may be incurred on currency exchanges when the Partnership or 
a Portfolio Manager changes investments from one country to another. Increased custodian costs 
as well as administrative difficulties (such as the applicability of foreign laws to foreign 
custodians in various circumstances, including bankruptcy, ability to recover lost assets, 
expropriation, nationalization and record access) may be associated with the maintenance of 
assets in foreign jurisdictions. 
Short Selling. The Investment Manager and/or many of the Portfolio Managers will 
engage in short selling for the Partnership when deemed appropriate to their respective 
investment strategies. This practice may include situations where the Investment Manager or a 
Portfolio Manager believes, on the basis of its research and analysis, that the relevant security is 
overvalued, or that supply of such security is greater than that likely to be absorbed by current or 
future demand. The Investment Manager and/or a Portfolio Manager may also use short selling 
in an effort to limit the exposure of the Partnership or particular positions to price declines or 
fluctuations. Selling securities short involves selling securities that the Partnership does not 
own. In order to make delivery to their purchasers, the Partnership must borrow securities from 
third party lenders. The Partnership subsequently returns the borrowed securities to the lenders 
by delivering to the lenders securities purchased in the open market. Short selling inherently 
involves certain additional risks. Selling securities short creates the risk of losing an amount 
greater than the initial investment in a relatively short period of time and the theoretically 
unlimited risk of an increase in the market price of the securities sold short. Short selling can 
also involve significant borrowing and other costs, which can reduce the profit or create losses in 
particular positions. 
Call Options. There are risks associated with the sale and purchase of call options. The 
seller (writer) of a call option which is covered (e.g., the writer holds the underlying security) 
assumes the risk of a decline in the market price of the underlying security below the purchase 
price of the underlying security less the premium received, and gives up the opportunity for gain 
on the underlying security above the exercise price of the option. If the seller of the call option 
owns a call option covering an equivalent number of shares with an exercise price equal to or 
less than the exercise price of the call written, the position is "fully hedged" if the option owned 
expires at the same time or later than the option written. The seller of an uncovered call option 
assumes the risk of a theoretically unlimited increase in the market price of the underlying 
security above the exercise price of the option. The buyer of a call option assumes the risk of 
losing his entire investment in the call option. 
Put Options. There are risks associated with the sale and purchase of put options. The 
seller (writer) of a put option which is covered (e.g., the writer has a short position in the 
underlying security) assumes the risk of an increase in the market price of the underlying 
security above the sales price (in establishing the short position) of the underlying security plus
