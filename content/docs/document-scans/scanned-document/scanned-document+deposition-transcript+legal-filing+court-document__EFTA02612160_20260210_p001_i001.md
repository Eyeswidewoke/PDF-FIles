"Sweetheart deal!" So goes the attack on the resolution of a =ong-ago federal investigation 
involving our former client -- and =ow-friend -- Jeffrey Epstein. The attack is profoundly misplaced, =upported neither 
by the law or the facts, nor by the structure of our =onstitutional republic. To the contrary, Jeffrey was subjected to =n 
aggressive federal intrusion into what would typically be considered = quintessentially local criminal matter in south 
Florida. His =ffense — at its core, sexual favors for =ire — has long been treated as a matter entrusted to =aws of the 
several States, not the federal government. His =onduct — while clearly unlawful and for which he has =ccepted full 
responsibility — was a classic state =ffense and was being treated exactly that way by able, honest =rosecutors in Palm 
Beach County. Nevertheless, far from =oing "soft" on the matter, the federal =overnment intervened. Ironically, now 
many for their own =pportunistic reasons are criticizing the federal decision-makers at the =ime, including now-
Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta (then the United =tates Attorney in south Florida), for not going far enough. =nbsp; 
The critics are wrong on the facts and the =aw. 
Here are the =rue key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made =usinessman with no prior 
criminal history whatsoever, engaged in =llegal conduct that amounts to solicitation of prostitution. His =onduct was 
wrong and a violation of Florida state law. Although =o coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs or the like were involved, 
some of =he women he paid were under the age of 18. Those facts were carefully assessed by =xperienced state 
prosecutors who aggressively enforce state criminal =aws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the =ublic 
order. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's =ffice conducted an extensive 15-month investigation, led by 
the chief =f the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by a =tate grand jury on a single felony count of 
solicitation of =rostitution. 
During that =ntense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and =nalyzed the 
evidence, =et face-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their =redibility -- or lack thereof -- and 
considered the extent of =xculpatory evidence. After months of negotiations, the state =rosecutors believed they had 
reached a reasoned resolution of the =atter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely =onsistent with 
that of cases involving other similarly-situated =efendants. The system worked as it should. =nbsp; 
Then, in came =he feds. The United States Attorney's Office extensively and =ggressively 
investigated whether Mr. Epstein had engaged in a =ommercial human trafficking ring, targeting minors. But that'= not 
what this was, and the federal authorities ultimately =cknowledged that, deferring prosecution to the state. But not 
=ithout conditions. The federal prosecutors insisted on many =northodox requirements that Mr. Epstein's experienced 
defense =eam had never seen imposed on any defendant anywhere. =nbsp;Under the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was 
required to request that the state prosecutors demand the imposition of a jail =entence, which would not have 
otherwise been required under the =reviously agreed-upon state disposition of this prostitution charge. =nbsp;Jeffrey 
accepted full responsibility for his conduct, =omplied with the feds' demand, served his sentence, and in =he process 
was treated exactly the same as other state-incarcerated =ndividuals. His conduct while in custody was exemplary, and 
so riharacterized by the state custodial authorities. =nbsp;
