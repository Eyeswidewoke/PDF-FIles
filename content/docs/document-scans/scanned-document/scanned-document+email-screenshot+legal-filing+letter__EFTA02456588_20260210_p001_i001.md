Re: 
i would ask you to think about music and melody, =AO i will send you a copy of what i sent to chomsky =AO i think the 
concept of harmonies, inter and intra-actions ,=of a ensemble of elements is a complex problem. a melody=is more 
than a collection of notes. it has an inter relation b=sed on key, rhythms, and progessions as well as variations on a 
them=. 
A series of notes like a series of neurona= firings wont tell much, it needs to be combined into a =oherent 
shape. it is easy for a novice to pick out=a wrong note in a melody heard for the first time. a disjointe=ness. . the 
smooth shapes have spikes that dont belong.=C2 . its the ensemble of neurons, firing rates=times and interactions 
that may be able to be mapped , I have =o idea, . algebraic geometry, algebrai= toplogy, ( surfaces rather than 
shapes ) , skype =nytime you like 
today I conducted an experiment e=couraged by Noam's wholly justified aggressive and detailed dire=tives to joscha.. 
joshcha foc=sed on layers being developed in the brain . the timing for the deve=opment of each layer being different 
per species. 
I postulate that music might be a frosted window into that structure. 
symphonies begin with their first "=layer " a 
theme. in fact , there might be more than one theme in the first layer , =AO , the second part of symphonic form is the 
complex development stage= where those themes are inverted, deconstructed , reconstructed =tc ,and the 
development stage takes the most time . in =the conclusion of the symphonic form the recapitulation of all that has 
come b=fore it forms a " phenenoma of the piece " a whole ,made up of its smaller concepts . =C2 As opposed to 
listening to music to record which neuron is firing, as mo=t musciolgists attempt . I propose that the music may be the 
audible result =f those neurons firing, made possible by a select few who would attempt=20 to notate those neuronal 
firings. Beethoven f=r example. 
The experiment . I mashed all o= the four symphonies together , playing recording= of the 3rd 5th 6th 7th all 
overlayed on each other, playing at the same time. - the way a brain mig=t develop. I expected an ordered noise but 
to the surprising cont=ary , 
IT WAS AMAZING. . you can hear new =AO "concepts " forming, 
it wonder whether in the mind of a blind child , the "=music" would be created even without the visual ref=rencial. but 
created none the less. later when the visual c=n be tied to concepts , the anatomy may be hijacked to produce sounds 
. that someh=w relate to the concepts. . 
I tried to mix mu=ic from different cultures- it didn't work. African =oes not work with western europe,- chi nese works 
with neither of the other two. but within the same cultu=al music ( the brain of the local species ) the mash ups 
are=20 beautiful. 
I would note that computers engage in "parallel processing" only in orde= to take a hard problem and break it into its 
component parts , working on each component separately, 
here each problem Interacts =and the their resolutions 
interact in remarkable ways.
