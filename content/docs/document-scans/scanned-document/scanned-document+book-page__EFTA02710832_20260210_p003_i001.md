As a result, it appears that canonical HI with a non-minimal 
gravitational coupling as the only new physical input appears 
extremely difficult to reconcile with the new observation of a 
large tensor contribution from inflation. If would appear to 
be necessary to add new physics to eliminate the dependence 
on non-minimal coupling entirely and to give the Higgs ef-
fective potential a shape compatible with observations. Such 
extension of HI tend to defeat the original purpose of the idea, 
namely its predictivity, and in any case most such modifica-
tions that have been proposed [42-44) tend to retain the now 
undesirable feature of small r in any case. 
There are two options that might allow large r consistent 
with BICEP. One possibility involves tuning the Higgs poten-
tial to form a second local minimum at large scales. i.e., a false 
vacuum similar to old inflation PSI. To avoid the problems 
of old inflation, a time dependent tunneling rate is introduced. 
While most mechanisms to achieve this, however, produce a 
small value of r (46), larger can be accommodated by adding 
a new scalar with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, such that 
the Higgs field sees a time dependent Planck mass NM A 
second possibility uses a non-canonical Galileon type kinetic 
term for the Higgs field. This model yields an r =-• 0.14 [48]. 
These tuned limits, variants, and extensions of the original 
HI model leave the door slightly open for the possibility of 
connecting the Higgs with the inflation field. However, with-
out additional scalars or modification of the Higgs potential 
via some other mechanism beyond the Standard Model, the 
original scenario. i.e. Higgs Inflation with only a non-minimal 
coupling to gravity, does not appear to be compatible with the 
BICEP result. 
Before we nail the coffin shut on Higgs Inflation, however, 
there is one possible additional source of uncertainty that mer-
its further investigation. As we describe below, when one goes 
beyond the tree level, there are gauge ambiguities involved in 
the calculation of effective potentials that need to be consid-
ered when deriving constraints on parameters. 
4. GAUGE DEPENDENCE AMBIGUITIES 
When working with a gauge theory, such as the Stan-
dard Model electroweak sector, calculations typically involve 
spurious gauge dependence that cancels when physical ob-
servable arc calculated. For example, in a spontaneously 
broken Yang-Mills theory one may work in the renormaliz-
able class of gauges (RO upon augmenting the Lagrangian 
with a gauge fixing term Cgi = —G°Ga/2 where 
= 
(1/ 1.
,f)(0,A° - 
xs) where x, are the would-be 
Goldstone boson fields and F° = riv, with 711 the sym-
metry generators and vj the symmetry-breaking vacuum ex-
pectation value. (See. e.g., [33]). A corresponding Fadeev-
Popov ghost term is also added. Physical or "on-shell" quan-
tities, such as cross sections and decay rates, may be calcu-
lated penurbatively, and any dependence on the gauge fix-
ing parameter, 4f , cancels order-by-order. Unphysical or 
"off-shell" quantities, such as propagators or one-particle irre-
ducible Green's functions, may harmlessly retain the spurious 
gauge dependence. 
The Coleman-Weinberg effective action f eff and effective 
potential Vof [49) have become standard tools in the study 
of vacuum structure, phase transitions, and inflation. The 
effective action is the generating functional of one-particle 
irreducible Green's functions, and therefore it is important 
to recognize that both "off and Kt f are off-shell quantities, 
which will carry spurious gauge dependence [28]. When ap-
plying the effective potential to a problem. special care must 
be taken to extract gauge-invariant information. In particu-
lar, the Nielsen identities express the gauge invariance of the 
effective potential at its stationary points, but derivatives of 
the effective potential are not generally gauge invariant [3 I]. 
This suggests that inflationary observables, e.g. ns, r, and 
dns/dlnk, naively extracted directly from the slow roll pa-
rameters will acquire a spurious gauge dependence. 
Ideally one would like to determine the "correct" proce-
dure for calculating physical quantities like us from a given 
model in such a way that the spurious gauge dependence is 
canceled. There have been significant efforts made in this di-
rection (23. 24]. but a full gauge invariant formalism is yet 
to be developed. Here we will take a different approach that 
is more aligned with recent work on the gauge dependence 
of phase transition calculations [34, 38. 39). Specifically, 
we numerically perform the "naive" HI calculation using the 
R{ gauge effective potential and RG-improvement to assess 
the sensitivity of the inflationary observables to the spurious 
gauge dependence. 
We begin by reviewing the familiar Higgs Inflation calcu-
lation. After moving from the Jordan to the Einstein frame, 
as described in Sec. 2. the resulting action contains a non-
canonical kinetic term for the Higgs field. One cannot, in 
general, find a field redefinition that makes the kinetic term 
canonical globally [21, 50]. At this point, it is customary to 
move to the unitary 'Inge where the Higgs doublet is written 
as ch(r) = e2"1.1r 1r (0, h(x)/4 2.. Then the kinetic term 
for the radial Higgs excitation can be normalized by the field 
redefinition x(h) where

and now 112 = 1 + h2/3/1,. 
Having canonically normalized both the gravity and Higgs 
kinetic terms, the derivation of the effective potential proceeds 
along the standard lines. We calculate the RG improved. one-
loop effective potential as described in the Appendix. After 
performing the RG improvement, the parameter A that appears 
in Eq. (3) should be understood at the running coupling eval-
uated at the scale of inflation. Generally, A < 0.1 and its 
value depends upon the physical Higgs boson and top quark 
masses at the input scale. For the best fit observed values, 
125 GeV and Mt xr. 173 GeV, the coupling runs neg-
ative at h ot 101° —1012 GeV; this is the well-known vacuum 
stability problem of the Standard Model [26). Successful HI 
requires an O(2o) deviation from central values toward either 
larger Higgs boson mass or smaller top quark mass. 
Gauge dependence enters the calculation at two places: ex-
plicitly in the one-loop correction to the effective potential and
