Opportunities and Challenges 
We have several opportunities to pursue with the Deering/Crosby family as 
outlined below. There are a few challenges. First, Heather Crosby runs an 
RIA that helps manage the Deering family assets. The RIA has pushed for an 
overly simple, low fee asset allocation. Despite serving as an RIA, they 
seem relatively unsophisticated. The Crosby assets are not managed by the 
RIA, and Heather handles this account more directly despite having limited 
time to focus on it. Her husband is a private equity partner, and earns a 
lot of money, so perhaps portfolio management isn't the first priority. 
Finally, the family and the RIA seem to have relationships with every bank 
on the street, so there is lots of competition. 
Deering — given the recent passing of Tony Deering, there will be a 
continued opportunity to reevaluate the asset allocation as his assets are 
passed to his wife and eventually to the rest of his family. We recently 
repriced a margin loan for the account 
Crosby - we would like to have more influence over how this account is 
traded. Heather has engaged directly in some options transactions, but has 
been resistant to doing anything more systematic like Harvest or structured 
notes. There is much more we could be doing if she were willing to hand 
over some control or focus more. She is contemplating a residency change to 
Florida and needs to do some estate planning, so this will be an opportunity 
for us to help and deepen the relationship. 
Matheys Lane (RIA) — There is real potential upside for us to get some 
business done with the RIA directly or with their other clients. They have 
not been willing to engage in that discussion to date. We may be viewed as 
a competitor more than a provider here. We need to learn more to understand 
this better.
