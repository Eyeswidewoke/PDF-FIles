Some people want to colonize Mars, I susggest before we =AO consider such a bold move we should learn to survive on 
our own=C2 planet,ie how to manage our lives in emergency situations, =ow to prevent them, and how to survive after 
in a most effective =ay at lower costs. The evidence that changed my life happened on Sep=ember 6, 2017, when 
hurricane 
Irma hit U.S Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico =nd then Florida. Millions of people were 
repeatedly cut off=from essential food aid and health care for extended periods of time.With =y degree in meteorology 
science, I knew that such a devastating =urricane and its disruptive impact on people's lives had been f=recasted long 
before it slammed into the islands and made the news.' ke=t wondering how was it possible to let people stay on the 
islands witho=t enough clean water supply, food, or ability to communicate with the main=and and underground 
hospital . The lack of essential necessities caused=a severe food crisis, water crisis, energy crisis, chaos, increasing =A0 
both the crime and the spread of various diseases. 
The evidence touc=ed my heart . In the twenty-first century, when people are trying to co=onize another planet, we still 
cannot successfully overcome challenges on =he Earth, and today we have to be more concerned about it as never 
befo=e. I know that the devastating effect of hurricane Irma was not the fau=t of the scientists who predicted it, but was 
a The Federal Emergency M=nagement Agency's , who should have prepared people and helped to =revent the 
economic sector from triple costs on things which could have=prevented. It happens everywhere, no matter in which 
country we live th= threat of natural disaster is a global disaster. What impressed me the=most is that disaster risk 
reduction has been a very low priority over =he past two decades. In this period, the international community 
committed=just over $3trillion in aid. 
For the past two decades, the internatio=al community spent 106,7 billion US dollars on disaster-related assis=ance, but 
of that106,7 billion, only 13,5 billion was invested in preve=tion and preparedness. Of overall aid financing over 20 
years, the $13.5 b=Ilion spent on DRR accounts for just 0.4% of the total amount spent on =nternational aid. Essentially, 
for every 
$100 spent on development aid,=just 40 cents have been invested in defending from the impact of =isasters. I believe 
that we have to change those numbers. We have to move =rom the tradition of response, to a culture of prevention. 
This i= something that we need to pay attention to because "A penny s=ved is a penny earned. "I consider Northeastern 
university bachelo='s degree completion the most valuable program I could use inor=er to fulfill my passion for gaining 
knowledge in management sci=nce. I view a two-year term as not only an efficient use of time but al=o as the only 
opportunity to fully emerse into the school's activi=ies while focusing primarily on the following three key areas of my 
pro=essional and personal interests. 
1. Acquire world-class managerial skil=s. I aim to accelerate my growth as a leader not only to be a more effe=tive and 
strategic management but also to prepare for the challenges ahead= In the current world where everything is changing 
so quickly, real-tim= experience in the field is sometimes even more important than theoreti=al knowledge. I see the 
education provided by Northeastern University ,=y immersing students in real-world experiential opportunities through 
c=-op programs necessary and the most effective to adapt to current manageme=t challenges. 
2. Gain functional knowledge I am passionate about findin= market opportunities and building effective solutions. For 
this reason= I am excited about learning from Northeastern professor Francesca Grip=a, who is also interested in 
promoting innovation and team effectiveness. = believe that reconsidering global management of will help to mitigate 
=he impact of natural hazards. 
3. Build an influential netwo=k. 
I am confident that in the diverse and ambitious NEU en=ironment, I can expand my network which I can later draw 
upon to sol=e a myriad of business and social problems. Most importantly, however, = will have an unparalleled
