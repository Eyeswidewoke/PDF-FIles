EDITORIAL: Should we give an ounce of credibility to Nygard's claims? I The Tribune 
Page 2 of 5 
His response: I paid no money to anyone to lie about Nygard. There are the women's stories, saying pretty 
much the same thing - and Fred believes them. 
Nygard, of course, has limitless funds and there are plenty of people eager to do his bidding for a slice of his 
grubby cash. 
Remember these stories. All facts accepted by the courts despite Nygard insisting he was the victim, not his 
accusers. 
Wendell Jones - found to be in contempt of court in a case concerning a smear campaign against Louis Bacon. 
Likewise with Sherman Brown. 
"I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Brown knowingly and deliberately made false statements 
before the Deputy Registrar and he knew and intended that, by lying in a court of law. he would impede and 
interfere with the proper administration of justice. Consequently, I find Mr. Brown to be in contumacious 
contempt of court." the court stated. 
In a case involving Nygard's acquisition of Nancy Ebker's sportswear brand a 12-year court battle ensued at 
the conclusion of which Judge Irving Cooper found that: "In contrast with the candid and credible testimony 
of Ebkcr [...] Nygard's demeanour on the witness stand was evasive and insincere, and he contradicted 
himself on numerous occasions throughout the course of his testimony. 
"... We unhesitatingly find the testimony of Nygard utterly lacking in credibility, and we reject his testimony 
insofar as it contradicts that of plaintiff." 
Dana Neal and Pat Prowse worked in Nygard's human resources department. Both publicly came forward 
with their experiences of working for him and he subsequently sued them for breach of confidentiality. 
"Dana Neal was quoted as saying: "I think they will do everything and anything in their power to discredit and 
hurt me and I think that those mechanisms are well underway." 
And who can forget Livingston "Toggi" Bullard and Wisler "Bobo" Davilma and the murder-for-hire plot. 
Bobo and Toggi admitted setting fire to a business in Wulff Road, which was owned by a former girlfriend of 
Nygard who had threatened to accuse Nygard of rape and take part in a blackmail scheme. The attack was a 
means of both punishing and intimidating against future actions. The fact of the fire is corroborated by a 
contemporary Royal Bahamian Police report of the incident. 
In a sworn statement Bobo stated: "So he said that she was going to risk a Picking warning. You know what I 
mean? And he even made a call to try to talk to her. And Sam and another girl, I can't remember the other 
girl's name." 
"... And he told us that he wanted to hurt her by any means necessary. Like that she had opened a business so 
you fucking gonna do it. so it was done.-... 
Interviewer: "What did Nygard pay you for the arson?" 
Bobo: "I don't remember if it's 10 or 20. I think its 10". 
Interviewer: "10 each?" 
Bobo: "Right" 
Bobo and Toggi further admitted to intimidating Michael Majors, over permits that Nygard wanted for his 
property development. They visited Majors at his office in the administrative planning department. threw his 
desk over and threatened to harm him if he did not start acting in Nygard's favour. In a swom statement Bobo
