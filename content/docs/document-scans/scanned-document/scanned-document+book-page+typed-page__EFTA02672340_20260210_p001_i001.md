The Truth about Lying: Inhibition of the 
Anterior Prefrontal Cortex Improves 
Deceptive Behavior 
Recent neuroimaging studies have indicated a predominant role of 
the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) in deception and moral 
cognition. yet the functional contribution of the aPFC to deceptive 
behavior remains unknown. We hypothesized that modulating the 
excitability of the aPFC by transcranial direct current stimulation 
(tDCS) could reveal its functional contribution in generating deceitful 
responses. Forty-four healthy volunteers participated in a thief role-
play in which they were supposed to steal money and then to attend 
an interrogation with the Guilty Knowledge Test. During the 
interrogation, participants received cathodal, anode], or sham tOCS. 
Remarkably, inhibition of the aPFC by cathodal tOCS did not lead to 
an impairment of deceptive behavior but rather to a significant 
improvement. This effect manifested in faster reaction times in 
telling lies, but not in telling the truth, a decrease in sympathetic 
skin-conductance response and feelings of guilt while deceiving the 
interrogator and a significantly higher lying quotient reflecting skillful 
lying. Increasing the excitability of the aPFC by anode] tDCS did not 
affect deceptive behavior, confirming the specificity of the 
stimulation polarity. These findings give causal support to recent 
correlative data obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging 
studies indicating a pivotal role of the aPFC in deception.

Introduction 
Deception is a complex cognitive act, with crucial legal, moral, 
and social implications. Functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) studies on neural correlates of deception have shown 
that the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex 
(ACC) were more strongly activated during lying than during 
telling the truth (Lee et al. 2002; Ganis et aL 2003). Recent 
knowledge about characteristic brain activation sites during 
deception enabled to recognize false statements with a pre-
cision between 88% and 99% (Davatzikos et al. 2(05). Canis 
et al. (2003) demonstrated that the anterior prefrontal cortices 
(aPFCs; BA 9/10) were engaged during general deception, but 
that the right aPFC was more involved in lies that were well 
rehearsed and were part of a coherent story than in 
spontaneous. noncoherent tics, whereas the ACC was more 
active during spontaneous generation of nonmemorized lies. In 
a recent positron emission tomography (PET) study, Abe et al. 
(2007) differentiated between the process of generating 
untruthful responses and the social intention to deceive an 
interrogator. The main effect of generating untruthful 
responses revealed increased brain activity of the left dorsolat•

scat prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; BA 8) and the right aPFC. 
whereas the left ventromedial PFC (BA I 1) and Antygdala were 
associated with the process of deceiving the interrogator. 
Funher analysis revealed that only the right aPFC was associated 
with both factors of deception, indicating that this region has 
a pivotal role in telling lies. Although these findings are quite 
remarkable, these ncumimaging studies have at least 3 short-
comings. Firm, a general problem of neuroimaging techniques 
like IMItl or PET is that they allow only correlative statements 
about the brain regions involved in a specific behavior (here 
deception). Causal relevance can be demonstrated with other 
methods allowing transient inhibition of conical excitability 
such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Karim et at 
2003; Amedi et at 200t; Karim, Schuler. et at 2004 Knoch et at 
2006) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (Nitsche 
and Paulus 2000, 2001; Nitsche. Schauenberg, et at 2003; Knoch 
et al. 2008; Priori et al. 2008). Second, the functional 
contrthution of the PIC to deception remains elusive. If, for 
instance, increased activation of the aPFC reflects cognitive 
processes involved in withholding the truth, suppression of this 
region should impair deceptive behavior. However, if increased 
activation of the aPFC: rather reflects a moral conflict involved in 
deceiving the counterpart, then suppressing this area should 
have exactly the opposite effect and 'improve deceptive 
behavior through behasioral disinhibitlon. Neuroimaging studies 
on psychopaths, classified as pathological liars, have demon-
strated that they have significantly less gray matter in the PFC 
(Yang et aL 2005) and that they do not show moral dilemma like 
healthy subjects (Anderson et at 1999). Thirdly. in previous IMRE 
studies, participants were instructed when to lie and when to 
say the truth. However, in cognitive processing, there is a crucial 
difference between a person who decides himself/herself 
whether to lie or to say the truth, and a person who merely 
follows the instruction of the investigator to lie for a predefined 
time in the MIRI scanner and then to say the truth in order to 
contrast the 2 conditions. 
The aim of this study was therefore I) to realize an 
experimental setup, in which participants should decide 
themselves, which questions they would answer truthfully 
and which ones with a lie and 2) to investigate the causal 
contribution of the aPFC in deceptive behavior by modulating 
the excitability of this brain region through tDCS. Three 
experiments were conducted to test the specificity of the 
transcranial stimulation effect. 
In the first experiment, 22 healthy subjects participated in 
a mock crime, in which they were supposed to steal money and
