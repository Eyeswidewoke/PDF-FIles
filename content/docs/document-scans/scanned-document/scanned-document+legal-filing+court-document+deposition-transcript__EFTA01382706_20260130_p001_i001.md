Third-Party Oversight —Our third-party oversight team establishes the risk management framework utilized in assessing and 
managing risks associated with third-party relationships entered into by the Jim for goods or services, with enhanced focus on third-
party vendor relationships involving critical activities that directly or indirectly support our clients. The third-party oversight program 
perfonns comprehensive risk management reviews throughout each stage of the third-party life-cycle, which includes initial planning, 
due diligence, contract review, ongoing monitoring and relationship termination. Risk assessment reviews cover a wide range of risk 
factors, including information security. operational and technology, financial, regulatory and compliance, reputational, physical 
security, country risk, fourth party risk, and resilience. Additionally, the third-party oversight team performs continuous ongoing 
monitoring activities of third-party relationships by means of onsite reviews, third-party score-cards, and periodic risk assessment 
analysis. 
In addition to providing First Data with a strong controls system, we believe our Controls Organization represents a strategic advantage 
to First Data as it enables us to work more effectively with our many clients who have complex regulatory and risk environments and to customize 
our solutions to fit their specific needs.
