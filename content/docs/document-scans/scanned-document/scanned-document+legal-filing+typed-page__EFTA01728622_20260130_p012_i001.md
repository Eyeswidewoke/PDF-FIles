In order to understand and investigate allegations of what constitutes "acquain-
tance" molestation, it is important to have a historical perspective of society's 
general attitudes about sexual victimization of children. A brief synopsis of these 
attitudes in the United States is provided here in order to give a context to this 
discussion. That context, hopefully, will help investigators better understand some 
of the problems and investigative difficulties encountered in these cases. 
In the United States, society's historical attitude about sexual victimization of 
children can generally be summed up in one word: denial. Most people do not 
want to hear about it and would prefer to pretend that such victimization just 
does not occur. Today, however, it is difficult to pretend that it does not happen. 
Stories and reports about child sexual abuse and exploitation are daily occur-
rences. Investigators dealing with sexual victimization of children must recognize 
and learn to address this denial. They must try to overcome it and encourage 
society to address, report, and prevent the sexual victimization of children. 
A complex problem such as the sexual victimization of children can be viewed 
from the three major perspectives of personal, political, and professional. The 
personal perspective encompasses the emotional—how the issues affect individual 
needs and wants. The political perspective encompasses the practical—how the 
issues affect getting elected, obtaining funding or pay, and attaining status and 
power. The professional perspective encompasses the rational and objective—
how the issues affect sexually victimized children and what is in their best 
interest. Often these perspectives overlap or are applied in combination. Because 
most of us use all three, sometimes which perspective is in control may not be 
clear. 
The personal and political perspectives tend to domi-
nate emotional issues like sexual victimization of children. 
The personal and political perspectives are reality and will 
never go away. In fact many positive things can and have 
been achieved through them (e.g., attention, adequate fund-
ing, equipment, manpower). In general, however, sexually 
victimized children need more people addressing their needs 
from the professional perspective and fewer from the per-
sonal and political perspectives. 
In their zeal to overcome denial or influence opinion, some individuals allow 
the personal or political perspectives to dominate by exaggerating or misrepre-
senting the problem. Presentations and literature with poorly documented or 
misleading claims about one in three children being sexually molested, the $5 
billion child pornography industry, organized child slavery rings, and 50,000 
stranger-abducted children are still common. The documented facts in the United 
States are bad enough and need no embellishment. True professionals, when 
communicating about the problem, should clearly define their terms and then 
consistently use those definitions unless indicating otherwise. Professionals should 
understand and cite reputable and scientific studies, noting the sources of 
information. Operational definitions for terms (e.g., child, pedophile, sexual 
exploitation) used in cited research should be dearly expressed and not mixed to 
distort the findings. Once someone is caught using distorted or misleading infor-
mation and labeled an extremist, people may not listen to what he or she says no 
In general ... 
sexually victimized children 
need more people addressing 
their needs from the 
professional perspective 
and fewer from the personal 
and political perspectives.
