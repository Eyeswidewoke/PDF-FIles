i =ould ask you to think about music and melody, i will send you = copy of what i sent to chomsky i think the

than a collec=ion of notes. it has an inter relation based on key, rhythms, =nd progessions as well as variations on a 
theme. =C2 A series of notes like a series of neuronal firings wont=tell much, it needs to be combined into a

today I conducted an experiment encouraged by Noa='s wholly justified aggressive and detailed directives to 
=oscha. . joshcha focused on layers b=ing developed in the brain . the timing for the development of each =ayer being 
different per species . 
I postulate that music might be a frosted window into that structure. 
symphonies begin with their first 
"=layer " a theme. in fact , there might be more than one theme in the first layer, =AO, the second part of symphonic 
form is the complex development stage= where those themes are inverted, deconstructed , reconstructed =tc ,and 
the development stage takes the most time . in =the conclusion of the symphonic form the recapitulation of all that 
has come b=fore it forms a " phenenoma of the piece " a whole ,made up of its smaller concepts . =C2 As opposed to 
listening to music to record which neuron is firing, as mo=t musciolgists attempt . I propose that the music may be the 
audible result =f those neurons firing, made possible by a select few who would attempt=20 to notate those neuronal 
firings. Beethoven f=r example. 
The experiment . I mashed all o= the four symphonies together , playing recording= of the 3rd 5th 6th 7th 
all overlayed on each other, playing at the same time. - the way a brain mig=t develop. I expected an ordered noise 
but to the surprising cont=ary , 
IT WAS AMAZING. . you can hear new =AO "concepts " forming, 
it wonder whether in the mind of a blind child , the "=music" would be created even without the visual 
ref=rencial. but created none the less. later when the visual c=n be tied to concepts , the anatomy may be hijacked to 
produce sounds . that someh=w relate to the concepts. . 
I tried to mix mu=ic from different cultures- it didn't work. African =oes not work with western europe,-
chinese works with neither of the other two. but within the same cultu=al music ( the brain of the local species ) the 
mash ups are=20 beautiful.
