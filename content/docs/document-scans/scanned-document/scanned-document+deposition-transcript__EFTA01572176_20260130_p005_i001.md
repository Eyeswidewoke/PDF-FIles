Important Information about Pricing and Valuations 
Market value information (including without limitation, prices, exchange rates, accrued income and b 
and ratings) furnished herein some of which has been provided by pricing sources or other sources 
that J.P. Morgan believes to be reliable, is not guaranteed for accuracy and is furnished for the ex 
clusive use of the client. 
J.P. Morgan makes no representation, warranty or guarantee, express or implied, that any quoted valu 
e represents the actual terms at which transactions or securities could be bought or sold or new 
transactions could be entered into, or the actual terms on which existing transactions or securities 
could be liquidated. Such values may only be indicative. 
The current price is the value of the financial asset share, unit or contract as priced at the close 
of the market on the last day of the statement period or the last available price. All values provi 
ded for 
structured yield deposits (for example, JPMorgan London Time Deposits) reflect the original deposit 
amount only. The value for Real Estate, Mineral Interests and Miscellaneous Assets may not reflect 
the most current value of the asset. 
Certain assets including but not limited to, pooled and private investments, non-publicly traded and 
infrequently traded securities, derivatives, partnership interests and tangible assets are generall 
illiquid, the value of such assets may have been provided to us by third parties who may not be inde 
pendent of the issuer or manager. Such information is reflected as of the last date provided to us, 
and 
is not independently verified. 
Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposi 
t products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are derived from proprietary 
models based upon well-recognized financial principles and we have, when necessary to calculate the 
present value of future cash flows, made reasonable estimates about relevant future market 
conditions. Valuations based on other models or different assumptions may yield different results. J 
.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates 
used in deriving the valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the value 
tions, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information 
purposes only and are intended solely for your own use. Please refer to the trade confirmation for d 
etails of each transaction. 
Important Information Regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt or preferred securities 
with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily, 
weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enou 
gh bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auctio 
n. In the 
event of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the se 
curity will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements and online.Accordingly, investor 
should not rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with respect to ARE. 
Where J.P. Morgan was unable to obtain a price from an outside service for a particular ARS, the pri 
ce 
column on your statement and online will indicate "$0.00" which however should not be relied on as t 
he price at which ARS would trade. 
These statements are not official documents for income tax reporting purposes and should not be reli 
ed upon for such purposes, including determination of income, cost basis, or gain/Loss. Such 
information, which may be inaccurate, incomplete or subject to updating, should be confirmed with yo 
ur records and your tax advisor.
