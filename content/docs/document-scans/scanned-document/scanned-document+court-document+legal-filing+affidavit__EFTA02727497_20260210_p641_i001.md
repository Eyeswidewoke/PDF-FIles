STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
1. Excusable Delays - Buyer acknowledges that the goods called for hereunder are to be 
manufactured for Buyer to fulfill this Agreement and that the delivery dates are based on 
the assumption that there will be no delay due to causes beyond the reasonable control of 
Sikorsky. Sikorsky shall not be charged with any liability for delay or non-delivery when 
due to delays of suppliers, acts of God or the public enemy, compliance in good faith with 
any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it 
proves to be invalid, fires, riots, labor disputes, unusually severe weather, or any other 
cause beyond the reasonable control of Sikorsky. To the extent that such causes actually 
retard deliveries on the part of Sikorsky, the time for Sikorsky's performance shall be 
extended for as many days beyond the delivery date as are reasonably required to obtain 
removal of such causes. This provision shall not, however, relieve Sikorsky from using 
reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes and continue performance with 
reasonable dispatch whenever such causes are removed. 
2. Inability Or Refusal To Pay - If Buyer is unable or refuses-to make payment to Sikorsky 
in accordance with any of its obligations to Sikorsky, Sikorsky may, at its option, 
terminate this Agreement by giving to Buyer written notice of its intention to terminate. 
Upon such termination, Sikorsky shall be relieved of any further obligations to Buyer and
