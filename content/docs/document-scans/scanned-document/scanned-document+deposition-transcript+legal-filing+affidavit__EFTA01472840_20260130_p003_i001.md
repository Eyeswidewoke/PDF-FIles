Important information 
As a New York State-chartered bank, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is 
required by law, under penalty of sanctions, to ensure that securities held 
by it as a custodian are segregated on its books and records from the Bank's 
own assets. In addition, internal control procedures are in place to prevent 
clients' securities from being commingled with the Bank's own assets. As an 
additional safeguard, the information systems that record and account for 
clients' custodied securities are independent from the systems within the 
Bank which track and control the Bank's proprietary assets. These 
segregation requirements required by law are intended to protect securities 
of custody clients against claims of creditors of a bank. In the event that 
there are cash deposits in a client's custody account, i.e. a money market 
deposit account, and such deposits are held within the Bank, then those 
deposits would be entitled to deposit insurance provided by the FDIC, 
subject to the limitations provided by Federal law. 
The past performance of securities or other instruments does not necessarily 
indicate or predict future performance and the value of investments and 
income arising therefrom can fall as well as rise, the investor may get back 
less than was invested and no assurance can be given that any portfolio or 
investment described herein would yield favorable investment results. Any
