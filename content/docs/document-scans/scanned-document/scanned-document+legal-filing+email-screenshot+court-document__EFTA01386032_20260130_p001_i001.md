Paul, find below the details of the Lebacs MS denominated offshore structure we discussed briefly the other day. 
We are currently in the process of bookbulidng the below note, although is still not completely guaranteed we will issue 
it as we are finalizing internal approvals and total size we raise. 
We also attach a proposal for hedging it in an asymmetric what that will give you equivalent USD yields although not 
fully hedged. 
Finally, a paragraph on the Argentina situation after the elections of last weekend and a report DB Research published 
last week on the Argentinean overall political situation and assets. 
Let's discuss when you have a second. 
Thanks 
Xavier

Argentina: Position for further upside 
The results of Argentina's mid-term elections confirm a very favorable scenario for President Macri's governing coalition 
in coming months and possibly years. "Cambiemos" had a stronger-than-expected national performance, having won 13 
provinces, including the five largest electoral districts (or about two-thirds of the population), securing its place as the 
first minority party in Congress and obtaining veto power against initiatives of the opposition. In the critical Senate race 
of Province of BA, Bullrich's lead over former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was larger than expected. 
Moreover, as most opposition leaders lost and other competitors also emerged weaker the bar is even lower for the 
incumbents to pass legislation. This means a strong boost for Macri's reform agenda and his bid for the 2019 
presidential race. Asset prices rallied on Monday following these results, but at a measured pace, suggesting market 
participants have largely positioned for the positive outcome. Also — as we have highlighted in recent research — the 
more subdued response is expected at this stage of the cycle and the policy mix favored by this administration (with a 
slow fiscal and disinflation path). This requires strong USD issuance and tight monetary policy for longer, which limit the 
room for more rapid reprising. See our recent report for a review of recent macro developments and outlook in 
Argentina, and discussion on how to position for this stage in the cycle. That said, this path was chosen to consolidate 
political power before moving on to the more challenging parts of fixing Argentina's macro framework. The success of 
the strategy should anchor the disinflation and adjustment paths and thus reduce the risk (for given yields). Accordingly, 
while valuation in credit may already look tight vs. its current credit standing, there is still scope for further tightening 
due to a). Potential multiple-notch credit ascension if reform agenda stay on track; b). The flattening of spread / quality 
curve in EM credit markets under the constructive external backdrop with continued inflows; and c). Alternative 
opportunities (with spread pickup) offered by EUR bonds, select local law USD bonds, select provincial bonds, and GDP 
Warrants.
