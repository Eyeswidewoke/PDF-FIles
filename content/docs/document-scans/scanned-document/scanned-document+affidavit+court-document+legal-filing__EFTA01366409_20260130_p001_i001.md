Notes to Financial Statements 
NOTE I —DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS - (continued) 
In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining 
available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the initial public offering price per 
Unit in the Proposed Offering. 
NOTE 2—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Presentation: 
The financial statements of the Company are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
Emerging Growth Company 
Section 102(bX I) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with 
new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is. those that have not had a Securities 
Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange 
Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a 
company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to 
non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not 
to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has 
differas application dates for public or private companies. the Company. as an emerging growth company, can 
adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. 
Net Loss Per Common Share: 
Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the 
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus to the extent dilutive the 
incremental number of shares of common stock to settle warrants, as calculated using the treasury stock method. 
At June 5. 2015, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially. be 
exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings or losses of the Company under the 
treasury stock method. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per common share for 
the period. 
Concentration of Credit Risk: 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash 
accounts in a financial institution, which at times, may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of 
$250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is 
not exposed to significant risks on such accounts. 
Financial Instruments: 
The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB 
ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures." approximates the carrying amounts represented in the 
balance sheet. 
Use of Estimates: 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
GLOBAL PARTNER ACQUISITION CORP.
