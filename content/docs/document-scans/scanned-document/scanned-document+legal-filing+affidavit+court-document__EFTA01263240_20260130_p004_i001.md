Martindel I, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an 
uncontested subpoena for 
documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be 
appropriate. Chemical Bank, 154 F.R.D. at 94. 
Second, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where, 
as here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders "that are 
on their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such 
circumstances reliance may be unreasonable." S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 230-31 (2d 
Cir. 2001). "Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of 
a protective order"—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of 
litigation—"a court may properly permit modification of the order." Id. (citing In re "Agent 
Orange" Prod. Liab. Litig., 821 F.2d 139, 147 (2d Cir. 1987)); see also Alien v. City of New York, 
420 F.Supp.2d 295, 301 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated 
interests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant protective order specified that a party 
could object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited 
on its face). In such a case, "'[w]hether to lift or modify a protective order is a decision committed 
to the sound discretion of the trial court."' TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 231 (modification in 
original) (citing In re Agent Orange, 821 F.3d at 147) (additional citations omitted). Here, the 
parties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public disclosure of such information at trial 
by the very terms of the Protective Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit 
described above. See Prot. Order at 5 ("This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on 
the use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this matter."). The parties could not 
have—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces 
Tecum-relied upon the Protective Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden. 
In this case, where the Protective Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages 
of the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for 
the victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily 
comply with the Subpoena, the "sound discretion of [this] court," TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 231, 
militates overwhelmingly toward limited, narrow modification of the Protective Order to permit 
compliance with the Subpoena.' This is consistent with the grand jury's "wide ranging authority 
to inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may 
compel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems 
necessary." Id. at 421-22; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 688 (1972) ("Although the 
powers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the 
longstanding principle that `the public . . . has a right to every man's evidence,' except for those 
2 The Government notes that any materials produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena fall under 
the protections and restrictions set forth in Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e), and further notes and emphasizes 
that the proposed order accompanying the Application provides no additional exception or 
modification to the Protective Order as to the recipient of the subpoena other than the narrow, 
limited ability to comply with grand jury process. The Protective Order will remain otherwise 
intact and fully enforceable.
