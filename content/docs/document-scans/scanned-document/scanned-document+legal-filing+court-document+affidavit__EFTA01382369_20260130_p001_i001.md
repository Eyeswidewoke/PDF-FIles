reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off or other transaction that affects our

dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the 2015 Incentive Plan or with respect 
to any award.

certain limitations, the committee may delegate its authority to grant awards to one or more committees consisting of one or more 
members of the board of directors or one or more of our officers. 
Amendment and Termination of the 2015 Incentive Plait. Our board of directors and the compensation committee may amend the 
2015 Incentive Plan at any time, subject to stockholder approval to the extent required by applicable law or regulation or the listing 
standards of the 
(or any other market or stock exchange on which our common stock is at the time primarily traded).

which may be issued under the 2015 Incentive Plan, change the eligibility requirements or decrease the exercise price of any 
outstanding option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2015 Incentive Plan. The board of directors and the compensation 
committee may amend the terms of any award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, however, except as otherwise provided 
in the 2015 Incentive Plan, no such amendment will, without the consent of the participant, alter or impair any rights of the participant 
under such award without the consent of the participant unless the award itself otherwise expressly so provides. 
Our board of directors and the compensation committee may suspend or terminate the 2015 Incentive Plan at any time. However, 
in no event may an award be granted pursuant to the 2015 Incentive Plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the 
2015 Incentive Plan. 
Prohibition on Repricing. Except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the company (including, without limitation, any 
stock distribution, stock split, extraordinary cash distribution, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, 
combination or exchange of shares), the administrator will not, without the approval of the stockholders, authorize the amendment of any 
outstanding award to reduce its price per share, including any amendment to reduce the exercise price per share of outstanding options 
or SARs.
