Do =ou think we can set something up to buy and lease farmland in =ussia? 
We have the best access, control and security as well as =eam/resources locally through my girl's family =perations. 
South of Russia has the best soil in the world ="black earth") 
As global stock =arkets fluctuate wildly, private equity funds and other large =nstitutions are increasingly looking to 
alternative investments to =rovide balance and stability to their portfolios. 
Given the rapid run-up =n agricultural commodities and food prices recently, farmland =nvestments are becoming an 
increasingly attractive asset =lass, writes Josh Cohn, a partner at alternative investment =roup GreenWorld BVI. It is also 
an ideal asset class for =rivate equity firms with long time horizons, as farmland is inherently =lliquid and usually 
requires at least a five to ten-year minimum =olding period to be worth the investment. 
In the UK for example, =ver the last ten years, agricultural land has appreciated roughly 13 =er cent per year in the 
according to Investment Property Databank =IPD). The US and other Western countries have seen similar =armland 
investment returns. Farmland prices have therefore =kyrocketed, reaching as high as E17,300 (approximately $30,000) 
per =ectare in the northwest of England to take just one example. 
As = result, investors are increasingly turning their attention to areas of =he world where farmland prices are starting 
from a much lower base, =hereby providing much greater upside potential. One area where =his has been particularly 
prevalent is Africa, where hedge funds and =ther large institutions have been making large agricultural farmland 
=nvestments. Hedge funds and private equity funds alone have =urchased 148 million acres of farmland in just the last 
three =ears. 
Given the long history of colonial exploitation in Africa, =here has been increasing resistance to what is perceived by 
many =estern Non-Governmental Organisations as well as Africans as a "foreign=land grab." Whilst some of these 
feelings may be based on old =tereotypes rather than current conditions, there is no question that =ome abuses have 
occurred. 
In an article in Businessweek, the =uthors noted one example of a large US agribusiness firm that invested =n Kenya. 
According to many local Kenyans, hundreds of people have =een displaced from ancestral farming lands, and promised 
investments in =ealth clinics and hiring of local staff have not =aterialized. 
What is undoubtedly true is that frequently large =nstitutional investors make deals directly with the central 
governments =f African countries. Given the amount of corruption and generally =oor governance that still exists in 
Africa, the investment dollars =requently disappear into the pockets of corrupt local officials whilst =ocal farmers are 
forcibly removed from their homes and lands. 
By =he same token, it is far from true that all foreign investments in =frican farmland are predatory and exploitive. 
Global consultancy =cKinsey recently produced a report on the future of Africa which noted =hat the continent had over 
25 per cent of the globe's arable land yet =roduced only ten per cent of agricultural output. McKinsey =ecommended 
that up to $50bn/year of African agricultural farmland =nvestment would be needed to bring the sector up to global 
=tandards.
