Wireless: Overweight Relative to the 06 Index 
If we had predicted it (which we didn't) no one would have believed it anyway. 
Consolidation seemed to be storing a lot of pent up momentum, with carriers 
locked out of talking to each other after years of successive spectrum auctions 
and FCC-imposed quiet periods. With the most recent auction concluding in 
January 2017 and a Republican in the White House planning to re-boot the 
FCC and DOJ, it seemed that a wave of telecom M&A was imminent, right? 
Wrong. The perception was that Sprint and T-Mobile were going to merge and 
that it was going to set off a wave of intra•sector and multi-sector convergence 
deals. Fueling this view was the perception (also proven wrong) that SoftBank 
was looking for the exit door in Sprint. The reality was that even though 
SoftBank and Sprint held countless discussions over many months with 
Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile USA (which has been widely disclosed in the 
press) and even with the press reporting that Deutsche Telekom made a last-
ditch offer to SoftBank to try to save the deal, SoftBank's response was to 
essentially "double-down" by deciding to keep Sprint independent, increase its 
CapEx spending, and raise its stake in Sprint, nominally, to 85%. So much for 
wanting the exit door. 
With Sprint emboldened to continue being an aggressor trying to win share in 
the market, we expect competition to remain elevated for the foreseeable 
future (although we also believe rationality in pricing will prevail). The raised 
competitive environment combined with the highly anticipated arrival of 5G in 
the next few years (mobile standards likely in 2019 and deployment in 2020), is 
expected to create a boon in wireless CapEx over the next couple of years. 
especially considering the amount of fallow spectrum (particularly at DISH -
more on that later) still needing to be built out, which all bode well for both 
macro tower companies as well as metro fiber players. 
Network and Spectrum: Each of the four nationwide carriers have significant 
projects they're working on to maintain existing and create new competitive 
advantages. Sprint has been the most vocal recently about significantly 
increasing CapEx over the next two years in order to improve coverage via 
macro tower expansion (a few thousand towers) as well as utilize Massive 
MIMO and small cell densification to harness the power of its unique 2.5 GHz 
spectrum. T-Mobile won 31 MHz of 600 MHz spectrum in the broadcast 
incentive auction that it has begun to roll out in 2017, but will more 
aggressively roll out in 2018. AT&T has 20 MHz of 700 MHz (FirstNet) and 40 
MHz of AWS-3 / WCS spectrum that will start to be built-out in 1018. The 
biggest benefactors from those 3 build-outs are the Big-3 macro tower guys 
(AMT, CCI, and SBAC). Verizon's focus on getting a head start in 5G via fixed 
wireless and fiber is most likely to positively impact the small cell / metro fiber 
specialists which include CCI and ZAYO.
