the election followed by minutes one that once again argued without any basis in fact that mail-
in balloting created a risk of voting fraud." Rothkopf advises, "Do not take lightly this 
president's threats no matter how far-fetched or outrageous they may seem. They reveal this 
man for who he is and what he represents: The greatest threat our democracy has faced from 
within since the Civil War." 
The New York Times (7/30, Burns, 18.61M) looks at who has the power to set and delay 
elections, while the Washington Times (7/30, Dinan, 492K) offers "a brief history of contested 
elections." The Daily Caller (7/30, Datoc, 716K) headlines its report "'No Way' - Top

Pompeo Says DO) "And Others Will Make That Legal Determination." The 
Washington Examiner (7/30, Simonson, 448K) reports Secretary of State Pompeo on Thursday 
"erroneously asserted that the Department of Justice will decide whether the presidential 
election is held on Nov. 3." At the beginning of a Senate hearing, Pompeo was asked about the 
President's tweet. Pompeo replied, "I'm not going to enter a legal judgment on that on the fly 
this morning. In the end, the Department of Justice and others will make that legal 
determination." 
Federalist Society Co-Founder: Trump Tweet "Is Itself Grounds For The 
President's Immediate Impeachment." Federalist Society co-founder Steven G. Calabresi 
writes in the New York Times (7/30, 18.61M), "I have voted Republican in every presidential 
election since 1980, including voting for Donald Trump in 2016." Calabresi adds that he also 
publicly criticized Robert Mueller's investigation of Trump and opposed the President's 
impeachment. He continues, "But I am frankly appalled by the president's recent tweet seeking 
to postpone the November election. Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the 
Democrats' assertion that President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic and is 
itself grounds for the president's immediate impeachment again by the House of 
Representatives and his removal from office by the Senate." 
Postal Service Employees Say Backlogs Adding To Mail-In Voting Concerns. The 
Washington Post (7/30, Lee, Bogage, 14.2M) reports, "As President Trump ramps up his 
unfounded attacks on mail balloting as susceptible to widespread fraud, postal employees and 
union officials say the changes implemented by the Trump fundraiser-turned-postmaster 
general Louis DeJoy are contributing to a growing perception that mail delays are the result of a 
political effort to undermine absentee voting." The Post says "days-long backlogs of mail across 
the country" after DeJoy "put in place new procedures described as cost-cutting efforts" come 
as Trump "has escalated his efforts to cast doubt about the integrity of the November vote." 
Trump Exhorts People Who Have Recovered From COVID To Donate Plasma. 
President Trump tweeted Thursday, "My Administration has been focused on finding treatments 
for Coronavirus. If you've recovered from Coronavirus, donate your plasma today to help SAVE 
LIVES! Together, we will beat the Virus!" The tweet included video of the President's visit 
Thursday to the Red Cross headquarters in Washington. 
The Washington Post (7/30, Johnson, 14.2M) reports Trump "issued a national call to 
action Thursday, exhorting people who have recovered from covid-19 to donate blood plasma to 
help others fight the disease and boost the nation's supply." Blood plasma from people "who 
have successfully recovered from coronavirus infection has been widely used in the United 
States, even though researchers are still gathering evidence to definitively show it works." 
About 50,000 people "have been transfused with the treatment, called convalescent plasma, 
under an expanded access program" sponsored by the FDA. NIH Director Collins said, "The way 
Americans are doing this is truly inspiring." Bloomberg (7/30, Edney, Jacobs, 4.73M) quotes 
HHS Secretary Azar as saying, "This is going to be a major national initiative in the months 
ahead."
