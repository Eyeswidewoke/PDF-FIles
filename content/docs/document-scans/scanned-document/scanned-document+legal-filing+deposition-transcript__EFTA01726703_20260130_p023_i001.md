NOTICE OF PROPOSED CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AND HEARING THEREON 
Christopher Boehr vs. American Express Centurion Bank, et al, 
Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, Case No. BC 256499 
TO: All current or former holders of credit cards or charge cards Issued by American Express Travel Related 
Services Company, Inc. or American Express Centurion Bank, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates or any of 
their predecessors (collectively, "American Express"), who at any time between August 22, 1995 and January 
27, 2004 either (1) incurred finance charges or (2) incurred a late fee within one day of the posting of a payment 
to their account (hereinafter, "Settlement Class"). 
THIS NOTICE MAY AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS - PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY 
This Notice summarizes a proposed class action settlement 
relating to your credit card or charge card account(s) with 
American Express. On January 27, 2004, this Court gave 
preliminary approval to the Settlement. The purpose of this 
notice is to describe the proposed Settlement to you and 
advise you of your rights. 
Description of the Litigation 
On August 21, 2001, plaintiff Christopher Boehr ("Plaintiff") 
filed a class action complaint (the 'Boehr Action') against 
American Express alleging that Settlement Class members 
incurred additional finance charges and late fees not 
authorized by their agreements with American Express 
when their payments were received by American Express 
after noon or on weekends or holidays because the 
payments were not credited until the following business 
day. American Express denies any wrongdoing, and has 
asserted numerous defenses to both liability and damages. 
Among other things, American Express contends that its 
payment crediting practice is expressly authorized by its 
agreements 
with 
Settlement 
Class 
members. 
Nevertheless, American Express has agreed to the 
proposed Settlement solely to avoid the burden of further 
litigation. Plaintiff believes that the claims asserted In the 
litigation have merit, but that the proposed Settlement is 
fair, reasonable and in the best interest of Settlement Class 
members given the risk and expense of further litigation. 
The Court has scheduled a hearing on July 30, 2004, at 
8:30 a.m. in Department 324 of the Los Angeles County, 
California Superior Court, located at 600 S. Commonwealth 
Ave., Los Angeles, Califomia 90005, to consider whether 
to grant final approval of the Settlement. 
Terms of the Proposed Settlement 
If the Settlement receives final approval, American Express 
will provide the following relief to the Settlement Class: 
Monetary Consideration. American Express has deposited 
$8,200,000 into an interest-bearing escrow account (with 
interest, the 'Settlement Contribution'). After payment from 
the Settlement Contribution of escrow costs, Class 
Counsel's fees and costs and the incentive award 
approved by the Court, American Express will credit or pay 
(as applicable) to each member of the Settlement Class a 
proportional share of the Settlement Contribution provided 
that such member's account has not, at any time prior to 
the date the Settlement Contribution is distributed, been 
written off by American Express and/or been in collection 
and/or been sold for purposes of collection. Distributions 
from the Settlement Contribution for corporate accounts will 
be paid to the corporate holder of the account rather than 
the individual card holders. 
Distributions will be made automatically for Settlement 
Class members whose accounts are open or who are 
receiving periodic statements. Settlement Class members 
whose accounts are closed and who are not receiving 
periodic statements must submit a timely and properly 
completed Claim Form in order to receive a distribution 
from the Settlement Contribution. 
tf you received this 
notice with your periodic statement, you need not submit a 
claim form. 
Non-Monetary Consideration. 
American Express will 
amend its cardmember agreements to clarify that payments 
received after noon or on weekends or holidays may not be 
credited until the following business day. 
American 
Express also will agree to continue at least until January 
27, 2006, its existing practice of not assessing late fees on 
revolving credit card accounts for payments received within 
24 hours of the payment due date, unless there is a change 
in substantive law preventing maintenance of this grace 
period. 
Attorneys' Fees. 
At the final approval hearing, Class 
Counsel will make an application to the Court for an award 
of attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $3,000,000 
plus a proportional share of net Interest on the Settlement 
Contribution. American Express will pay attorneys' fees 
and costs awarded by the Court not to exceed this amount. 
The attorneys' fees and costs will be paid out of the gross 
Settlement Contribution. American Express will also pay a 
reasonable and customary incentive award, in an amount 
awarded by the Court, but not exceeding $10,000, to 
Plaintiff. 
Based on their substantial investigation and discovery in 
the action, Class Counsel believe that the Settlement is 
fair, reasonable and in the best interests of Settlement 
Class members. 
Your Rights 
If the Settlement receives final approval, each member of 
the Settlement Class who has not obtained proper and 
timely exclusion from the Settlement Class, their respective 
heirs, executors, administrators, representatives, agents, 
attorneys, partners, successors, predecessors-in-interest, 
assigns, and any authorized users of their accounts will be 
deemed to have fully released and forever discharged 
American 
Express, 
its 
present, 
former
