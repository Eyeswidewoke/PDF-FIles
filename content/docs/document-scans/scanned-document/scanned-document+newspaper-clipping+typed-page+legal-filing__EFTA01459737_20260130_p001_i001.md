With the ongoing volatility in risky assets and global 
bond yields flashing warning signs by falling sharply in 
recent weeks, the chorus of recession talk has grown 
even louder. While the U.S. Citigroup Economic 
Surprise Index has fallen to an eight month low and 
the U.S. ISM Manufacturing Index has been in 
contraction territory for the past four consecutive 
months, it is understandable the market jitters are 
surfacing. However, our "fab five" economic 
indicators, which we view as a real time gauge of the 
true health of the U.S. economy paints a more 
optimistic picture and suggests U.S. economic growth 
is on solid footing. Our "fab five" indicators include: 
1. Jobless claims — claims have moved modestly 
higher but still remain below 300K, a level that has 
historically been supportive of ongoing 
improvement in the labor market. 
2. Withholding tax receipts — tax receipts remain near 
record highs suggesting more people are working 
and should support consumer spending. 
3. Motor vehicle sales —vehicle sales are a good 
gauge on the true health of the consumer because 
a consumer would not make a big ticket purchase 
if they were concerned about their job or wage 
prospects. Monthly vehicle sales are hovering near 
the highest level since 2005. 
4. ISM production — Despite weakness in the overall 
Index, production rose for the second consecutive 
month and is back in expansion territory. 
5. Commercial and industrial loans — Demand for 
commercial and industrial loans has been strong 
for 20 consecutive quarters.

Next week we will receive a number of economic data 
points that will give us better insight into the condition 
of the U.S. economy. Looking at the labor market, we 
will receive both the NFIB Small Business Optimism 
Index and JOLTS report (Tuesday). While the NFIB 
Index will also give us a good indication of the 
sentiment among small business owners, we will look 
closely at the hiring plans component of the report. In 
addition, the report also outlines owners views on 
raising wages and their plans to increase capital 
spending. With respect to JOLTS, job openings are 
expected to remain near a cyclical high, pointing to 
additional strength in the labor market. From a 
consumer perspective, both consumer sentiment and 
retail sales will be released Friday. Despite the equity 
market volatility, consumer sentiment is expected to 
rise to 93.0. Retail sales are also expected to rise 
(+0.1% MoM), which would be the third month in the 
past four of retail sales gains. 
Outside of economic data, the key focus will be on 
Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony before 
congress (Wednesday & Thursday). Given the 
softening in U.S. data and volatility in financial 
markets, her thoughts on the health of the U.S. 
economy and opinion on the ongoing weakness in 
other major regions will be important. Additionally, we 
look to see if the Fed Chairwoman provides any 
further indication to the timing and pace of Fed rate 
hikes. Currently, the futures market is not pricing in a 
Fed rate hike until 2017 at the earliest, while Fed 
projections continue to show four rate hikes in 2015.
