1.Pre-money valuation was estimated at $3,338,710, and $1.SMM investment was intended to be 31% of Company on a 
fully diluted basis. Now $1.SMM bu=s 25% on a fully diluted basis based on a $4.5 MM company valuation. However, to 
get EB up to 31% he is being offered up to 6% of ordinary=20 shares for serving as director. The 6 percent vests in 8 
equal quarterly installments over 2 years. However, by doing it this way, 1=20 believe the warrant exercise prices which 
are based on a percentage of the original purchase price per share will start at a higher exercise price per share. 
2. Regarding warrant exercise prices, you may recall that in the last iteration of the term sheet, the investor was to be 
given two sets of warrants: one set of $1MM worth of warrants exercisable at any time over a 4 year period at 150% of 
the purchase price per share of the preferred shares in this investment; and the second set of $2.5MM of warrants 
exercisable at any time over a 4 year period at 175% of the purchase price per share of the preferred shares in this 
investment. Now this has been=20 changed so that only for the 1st two years of the 4 year exercise period are the 
warrants exercisable at 150% and 175% of the purchase price per share, respectively. In the third year the exercise 
prices increase =o 195% and 225%, respectively, of the original purchase price per share, and in the fourth year, the 
exercise prices increase to 240% and 275%, respectively of the purchase price per share. If the original intent=20 was 
for the warrants to enable EB to acquire a majority interest of the Company, with the increase in the original purchase 
price per share, while the aggregate dollar amount that may be exercised remains the same, even with a full exercise of 
all $3.5 MM of warrants in the first two years (i.e., with an exercise price at 150% and 175% of the purchase price per 
share), it does not appear that EB will acquire a majority interest. He certainly won't when the exercise prices are 
inc=eased in years 3 and 4 of the warrant exercise period.

3. There is a note that is deleted about there being a finders fee payable to Echar Erez under which he was supposed to 
receive cash in the amount of 2.5% of the investment amount, plus options for 2.5% of the investment shares. Although 
the note was deleted, I wonder whether that fee is=20 being paid somewhere. 
4. They put a time limit of 2 years on price anti-dilution. They also change= the description of the price anti-dilution 
from broad based weighted average to narrow based weighted average. 
5. Whereas previously any deemed liquidation event would require EB approval, now only liquidation events where EB 
would receive less than 400% of his investment require EB approval. 
6. Whereas budget variations required EB approval now only if the budget varies by 10% in any given month (and not in 
the aggregate) would prior approval be required. 
7. incurring any single debt o= $100K or more would require EB approval. Obviously this can be avoide= with a series of 
separate debt transactions. 
8. Financial reporting that was unaudited monthly reports 15 days after the end of every month, unaudited quarterly 
financials 45 days after end of each of the first, second and third quarters and audited annual financials 60 days after the 
fiscal year end has been changed to 30 days for monthly reports, 60 days for unaudited quarterly financials and 90 days 
for audited annual financials.
