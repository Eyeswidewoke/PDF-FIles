The head of JPM Asia is leaving. Its they guy who probably did not like me and I 
told Jes he is no good for China. 
New big appointment. The man needs our help 
JPMorgan relocates key executive to Asia 
By Tom Braithwaite in New York and Paul Davies and Benny Sender in Hong Kong 
JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by assets, is moving its head of investment 
banking coverage from New York to Hong Kong as part of a push into Asia and a 
wider sign of western banks looking east for growth. 
Jeff Urwin will continue to run worldwide capital markets and mergers and 
acquisitions from his new office in Hong Kong in a rare example of a western bank 
basing a global investment banking job in Asia. 
"We've never done something like this where we've taken the head of one of the 
major businesses in the bank and moved it to Asia," said Jes Staley, chief 
executive of JPMorgan's investment bank. "That type of role has usually been 
based in New York and occasionally in London." 
"It's a very significant statement that the client business is increasingly 
global and that Asia is increasingly a place of interest - for clients based in 
Asia and for European, American and Latin American clients expanding into the 
region," he said. 
It might be the source of growth for the future, with bankers expecting more 
cross-border dealmaking from the likes of India's Tata, China's Geely and a host 
of Japanese companies. But Asia has recently proven a difficult market for US 
banks, including JPMorgan. 
Bankers complain about lower bonuses and restrictions on travel for many but the 
key moneymakers after equity and M&A activity slumped in the second half of last 
year and failed to recover so far this year, although debt markets have seen 
record activity. 
JPMorgan's own Asian investment banking revenues in the first quarter were down 
32 per cent versus the same period last year, but other banks that split out 
regional revenues saw different results. 
Morgan Stanley's Asia business turned in the strongest regional revenue growth, 
while Citicorp's securities and banking division in Asia was its second-best 
performer with 17 per cent revenue growth. 
However, US banks are seen by some as having a competitive advantage, partly 
better of access to dollar funding than European and local players - the US 
currency dominates capital market and cross-border trade activity in the region. 
Equity capital markets has been a source of fees in the past decade, driven 
partly by large Chinese listings. Haitong Securities last year became the biggest 
initial public offering this year in a share sale underwritten by JPMorgan. 
Mr Urwin, a 56-year-old who was born in England and holds British and US 
citizenship, acknowledged that the market had slowed, though said: "There is a 
pretty strong pipeline. The question is whether investors step up." 
The wisdom of trying to run from Hong Kong a business that is still dominated by 
US companies is still up for debate. Bankers speculated that the timezone 
difference made it very difficult to do. 
Mr Urwin adds the title of chief executive of Asia Pacific, succeeding Gaby 
Abdelnour, who has announced he is leaving the bank. Along with Barry Sommers, 
who runs wealth management, Mr Urwin is the leading survivor from Bear Stearns, 
which JPMorgan acquired in a rescue purchase during the financial crisis. As part 
of its push into China JPMorgan is setting up a trust company joint venture with 
the tiny Henan-based Bridge Trust Co. The move comes a few months after the US 
bank decided in November to move forward with a credit guarantee operation at the 
behest of the National Development and Reform Commission, a powerful central 
planning agency which has been taking steps to support China's smaller companies.
