HEADLINE: THE BOSS WHO DISAPPEARED FROM HIS YACHT 
BODY: 
IN CORPORATE governance there are not always 'right' and 'wrong' answers, writes Robert Wearing in 
Cases in Corporate Governance from Sage (www.indiasage.com). The book compiles stories of nine companies 
that tripped on the governance wire, including Enron and Barings, Parmalat and Eurotunnel, iforldCom and 
BCCI. Don't expect easy solutions to the problems identified in the case studies, warns the author about 
the book. 
Some common themes are outlined in the cases presented. For example, "charismatic and powerful 
business leaders, companies experiencing rapid and unsustainable rates of growth and unnecessarily 
complicated organisation". 
The purpose of the book, as Wearing explains is, "to provide some insight into why corporate 
governance can break down and to look at what might be done to remedy such situations". 
The author cites T. Clarke's view that there will never be a 'perfect' system Of corporate governance. 
"It is important that the most obvious abuses will be outlawed, and loopholes closed, but the ingenuity of 
self-interest will lead to the devising of new schemes to evade accountability." Wearing highlights the 
need for a trade-off between too much regulation that can inhibit wealth creation and too little 
regulation that can lead to abuses. "Corporate governance regulation can claim to be successful if it 
encourages a business environment where warning signals are picked up early and appropriate action is 
taken quickly by the regulators." 
The first case is on Robert Maxwell and it opens with his disappearance from his yacht, Lady 
Ghislainel Maxwell used four methods to misappropriate funds from the companies under his control, you'll 
learn. "He pledged assets as security for additional loans", but instead of delivering the assets to the 
lender, he would simply sell the assets for cash. "For example, Berlitz language school was supposedly 
sold to a Japanese publishing company, but the shares had previously been pledged as security for loans 
from Swiss Volksbank and Lehman Brothers." For the other three methods and the eight remaining cases, you 
know where to look. Well written! 
Brazil is like Captain Ahab 
IN THE US, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASS) has suggested that the contingent 
conversion feature (CoCo) should not release companies from accounting for the potential EPS dilution 
caused by the shares underlying a convertible using an 'if-converted' method. That's how the first chapter 
in The Euromoney's International Equity Capital Markets Handbook 2005, distributed by Bharat Book Bureau 
(www.bharatbook.com), begins. 
Under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) rules, issuers will have to bifurcate the 
bond and the option component of equity-linked instruments, writes Martin Piach in 'The global convertible 
market: Recent trends and developments'. 
Another chapter provides 'an overview of algorithmic trading'. Recent industry research has shown that 
there is still a large quantity of transaction costs that can be avoided via efficient algorithmic 
execution strategies, write Robert Kissell and Andrew Freyre-Sanders. 
"But this requires investors to become more proactive in the process by specifying macro level 
execution strategies and micro-pricing schemes consistent with overall investment objective::," they add. 
If all this seems too tough to comprehend, move over to the chapter on inflation, with a Moby Dick 
analogy included.
