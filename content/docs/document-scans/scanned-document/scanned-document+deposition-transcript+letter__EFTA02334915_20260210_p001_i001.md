Couple of things. 
I have remembered a man that I interviewed that I think would be excellent for 
you to run your house and be your butler and who will work 365 and 25 hours a 
day. I interviewed him for myself and would have hired him except that I decided 
to stick with a couple ( it was when I was thinking I did not need a couple). I 
have a call into him and will see him this week see if he is interested and if 
when I see him again I still like him as much I'll give him to you. Also I have 
set up a couple of interviews w/other people for you in NY this week and with 
luck will find someone that you will like and that will run your house the way 
that you want and eliminate that area of frustration for you 
I think that you should use this time to have Howard start a manual for you 
The easy bit is to create a list of all the trades that come to the hse + their 
phone no.s. (Pool, exterminator, electrician, a/c person etc does the laundry get 
delivered or picked up?) + when they come, if it is regular visits ie, every week 
or 2 and what day and what time. This should be done for weekly monthly and 
quarterly visits 
Next he has to give you a list of all his responsibilities and a schedule of what 
he does each day. It starts with what time he arrives at work and then what he 
does for the rest of day. He should have ec staff member do the same inc the 
gardener 
There needs to be a list of all emergency no's incase something happens in the 
hse who do they contact and a procedure for anything that breaks etc 
There should be a list of all the shops where things are purchased 
Once you have this list and what ec person does you can then change the schedule 
to include things that you would like to have happen and the order that they 
happen in. Ie, what do you want Howard to do first thing in the morning (and at 
what time) open the cabana, put out the towels Put the car out front (which one, 
depends on the weather) Fill w/petrol etc or what ever you want 
The added benefit of having Howard do this for you is that it will concentrate 
his mind on his job and you will be much happier w/him as he will become more 
efficient and more accommodating to your needs 
Let me know if you want me to help in any way - I can review it once you have 
the beginnings of the manual. 
Just to let you know that I have an envelope which my houseman gave me which I 
think has your cheque in it which I will give you when I next see you or I can 
send to you or trash - let me know 
Thank you again for the thought and the wonderful present - I appreciated it more 
than you can imagine
