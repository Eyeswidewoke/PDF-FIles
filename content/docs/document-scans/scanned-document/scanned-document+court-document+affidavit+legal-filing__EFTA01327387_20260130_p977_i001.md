demand, together with interest at the rate computed as provided in Paragraph 2 of the Promissory Note until paid 
in full. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall at all times keep the Collateral, and any proceeds

of the Collateral and any such proceeds. 
8. Default Upon Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, RACC may require Debtor to assemble the Collateral 
and make it available to RACC at a place to be designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to both 
parties. The requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification to Debtor of the 
time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or other 
intended disposition is to be made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's address, as 
shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable 
expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with reasonable 
costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and after the payment of the principal and interest 
due under the Promissory Note, the balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be applied to the payment of 
any or all other indebtedness of Debtor to RACC, whether due or not, whether direct or indirect absolute or 
contingent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether owing individually or in connection with others 
not parties hereto, and to the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the 
Collateral of which RACC has received notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for any 
deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law. If after a default by Debtor, the 
Collateral is returned to or recovered by RACC, Debtor agrees RACC may fly or otherwise move the Collateral for 
demonstration and other purposes reasonably related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of 
the Collateral.

may declare all indebtedness due under the Promissory Note, as well as any other Indebtedness or liability 
of Debtor to RACC, Immediately due and payable. 
In addition to the foregoing, RACC may (a) sell, or instruct any agent or broker to sell, all or any part of the 
Collateral, and direct such agent or broker to deliver all proceeds thereof to RACC and apply all proceeds to 
the payment of any or all of the unpaid balance owed pursuant to the provisions contained in this Security 
Agreement, in such order and manner as RACC shall choose, In Its discretion, and/or (b) cause title to the 
Collateralto be transferred into the name of RACC or its designee. 
Debtor understands and agrees that any sale by RACC of all or part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of 
this Security Agreement may be effected by RACC at a time and in a manner which could result in the 
proceeds of such sale being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had 
occurred at a different time or in a different manner, and Debtor hereby releases RACC and its officers and 
representatives from and against any and all obligations and/or liabilities arising out of or related to the 
timing or manner of any such sale. All rights and remedies of RACC provided herein are subject to the 
limitations set forth in the Governing Documents that relate to Debtors interest in the Collateral. 
10. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective unless in writing, nor operate as a 
waiver of any other default or of the same default in the future. 
11. Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior written consent of RACC, sell or otherwise 
transfer or encumber the Collateral, or any interest therein, or offer to do so or, except in accordance with the 
Governing Documents, permanently remove or attempt to permanently remove the Collateral from the United 
States. Debtor will keep the Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will not 
permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied. 
12. Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes and assessments upon the 
Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this Security Agreement and the obligations evidenced by the 
Promissory Note.
