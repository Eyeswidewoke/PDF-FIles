of grass—more like a reed than a piece of lumber-and 
it has a natural sensitivity that more modern materials 
lack. Bamboo fans say that their rods cast more flu-
idly, that their slight extra weight does more of the 
work, and that they're better at cushioning light lead-
ers. Where a graphite caster would talk about power 
and efficiency, one who uses bamboo might invoke 
terms such as "warmth" and "friendliness." 
There's also the matter of uniqueness. Part of the 
character of every rod is imparted by the particular 
calm of bamboo from which it was made—its size, age, 
density, moisture content, whether or not it was heat-
treated and if so, how—so that even among identical 
rods by the same maker there can be discernible dif-
ferences. And bamboo rods, like violins, are said to 
evolve with use, so even if a rod doesn't have a person-
ality the first time you string it up, it will after you've 
fished with it for a few seasons. 
Is this all beginning to sound a little mystical? Well, 
that's how they get under your skin. The late rod-
maker Charlie Jenkins once told me that half of what 
his customers were buying was the image of the lone 
craftsman in his workshop with his glasses pulled 
down on his nose, hand-making their rod. That sounds 
mostly right to me. Of course, Charlie was too modest 
to add that, in his case, the other half was one damned 
fine fly rod. 0

fished stripers there as a guest.

Moneyed anglers are going farther 
afield than ever to pursue Atlantic 
salmon, as commercial harvesting, 
climate change, and other ills have 
reduced North American runs. 
The new hot spot is Russia's Kola 
Peninsula. whose 25 million acres 
of tundra and salmon rivers lie 
almost entirely within the Arctic 
Circle. The southerly Ponoi River 
is so much better than everything 
else: according to globe-trotting 
guide Oliver White. Frontiers 
International Travel spokesperson 
Mollie Fitzgerald agrees: "They 
catch in a week what many places 
in Scotland or eastern Canada 
catch in an entire season"—on 
average. 28 fish per rod. 
• THE LODGE Ryabaga Camp 
enjoys exclusive access to 50 miles 
of the wide. easy-flowing Ponoi. 
which guests of all skill levels can 
fish on toot or by boat. Unlike its 
northerly neighbors, the Ponoi has 
two mini seasons, in early and late 
summer. The accommodations 
have recently been upgraded 
from canvas tents to duplex wood 
cabins with en suite bathrooms. A 
major selling point is the variety of 
accessibility—that is. once you've 
taken the weekly charter flight 
from Helsinki and the two-hour 
helicopter ride from Murmansk.

THE GUIDE Ryabaga's Max 
Mamaev has spent two decades 
on the Ponoi. "He is truly one of 
the world's greatest guides—so 
resourceful, so industrious. I heard

of a chemical warfare suit: White 
says. "And I believe it."

THE AMAZON 
The crazy-colored peacock bass is 
just one of many fascinating crea-

breath away. The capable guides at
