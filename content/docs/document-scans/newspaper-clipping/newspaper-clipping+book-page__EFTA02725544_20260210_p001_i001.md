CULTURE 
The man who runs the 
Since the mid-1960s, John Brockman has been at 
the cutting edge of ideas. Here, John Naughton 
introduces a passionate advocate of both science 
and the arts, whose website, Edge, is a salon for 
the world's finest minds. On the facing page they discuss 
Marshall McLuhan, elitism and the future of the internet 
T
. 
o say that John 
Brockman is a literary 
agent is like saying 
that David Hockney 
is a photographer. 
For while it's true 
that Hockney has 
indeed made astonishingly creative 
use of photography, and Brockman is 
indeed a successful literary agent who 
represents all enviable stable of high-
profile scientists and communicators, 
in both cases the description rather 
understates the reality. More accurate 
ways of describing Brockman would be 
to say that he is a "cultural impresario" 
or, as his friend Stewart Brand puts it, 
an "intellectual enzyme". 
The first thing you notice about 
Brockman, though, is the interesting 
way he bridges CP Snow's "IWo 
Cultures" - the parallel universes of the 
arts and the sciences. When profilers 
ask him for pictures, one he often sends 
shows him with Andy Warhol and Bob 
Dylan, no less. But he's also one of the 
few people around who can phone 
Nobel laureates in science with a good 
chance that they will take the call. 
Cynics might say that this has 
something to do with the fact that 
Brockman has a reputation as an agent 
who can extract massive advances 
from publishers. And he is indeed a 
hustler who spotted early on that there 
was a massive audience for writing 
about science. but there's more to 
it than that. Brockman is genuinely 
passionate about big ideas. He is 
fascinated, he told Wired magazine, 
"by people who can take the materials 
of the culture in the arts, literature and 
science and put them together in their 
own way. We live in a mass-produced 
culture where many people, even 
many established cultural arbiters, 
limit themselves to secondhand 
ideas. Show me people who create 
their own reality, who don't accept an 
ersatz. appropriated reality. Show me 
the empiricists - and not just in the 
sciences - who are out there doing it, 
rather than talking about and analysing 
the people who are doing it." 
Brockman's immersion in both sides 
of the Teo Cultures runs deep. He did 
an MBA at Columbia in the early 1960s 
and started his own financial leasing 
company on Park Avenue. But a friend 
introduced him to avant-garde theatre, 
thereby launching him on the primrose 
path into the arts. 
He then got involved in the city's 
underground movie scene, becoming 
manager of the Film-Makers' 
Cinematheque, the home of 
underground cinema, in 1965. where 
his mandate was to produce a festival 
that expanded the form of cinema. 
He commissioned 30 performance 
pieces by world-class artists, dancers, 
poets, dramatists and musicians. The 
resulting festival made a big splash. 
"I ntermedia", the term Brockman 
coined and used as his logo, was 
suddenly hot. A number of notable 
art-world figures were immersed in the 
genre, among them Les Levine, Robert 
Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, several 
kinetic and "happenings" artists, avant-
garde film-makers and dramatists, the 
Velvet Underground, and composer 
John Cage. 
This immersion in New York's 
arts scene also led todeep interest in 
science and technology. Many of the 
pieces at the festival were informed by 
artists' interest in cybernetics. They 
were reading and discussing books by 
scientists. Rauschenberg suggested 
to Brockman that he read George 
Gatnow's One. Two, Three... Infinity and 
The Mysterious Universe. Gerd Stem, 
co-founder of media collective USCG, 
who performed in conjunction with 
talksby Marshall McLuhan, introduced 
Brockman to several scientists and 
eventually arranged for him to meet 
McLuhan and his colleagues. 
In cyberspace, Brockman is best 
known for Edgeorg, a site he founded 
as a continuation of what he describes 
as "a failed art experiment" by his 
late friend. performance artist James 
Lee Byars Byars believed, Brockman 
recalls, "that to arrive at a satisfactory 
plateau of knowledge it was pure folly 
to gu to Widener Library at Harvard 
and read six million books. Instead, 
he planned to gather the 100 most 
brilliant minds in the world in a room, 
lock them in and have them ask one 
another the questions they'd been 
asking themselves. The expected result 
- in theory - was to be a synthesis of 
all thought." But it didn't work out that 
way. Byars did identify his 100 most 
brilliant minds and phoned each of 
them. The result: 70 hung up on him! 
Byars died in 1997, but Brockman 
persisted with his idea or at any 
rate with the notion that it might be 
possible to do something analogous 
using the Internet. And so Edge.org was 
born as a kind of high-octane online 
salon with Brockman as its editor and 
host. Ile describes it as "a conversation. 
We look for people whose creative 
work has expanded our notion of who 
and what we are. We encourage work 
on the cutting edge of the culture and 
Brockman can 
phone Nobel 
laureates with 
a good chance 
that they will 
take the call 
the investigation of ideas that have not 
been generally exposed." 
As of now•, the roll call of current and 
deceased members of the Edge salon 
runs to 660. They include many of 
the usual suspects (Richard Dawkins, 
Craig Venter and Stewart Brand, for 
example). It's a predominately male 
crowd, with women accounting for 
only 16.5% of the members - which is 
probably a reflection of the fact that 
science is still largely a male-dominated 
business. There arc a lot of what one 
might call the "digerati" - the Clay 
Shirkys, Douglas Couplands and 
Howard Rheingolds of this world. 
Two generations of the Dyson clan 
are represented - the great physicist 
Freeman and his two kids, Esther and 
George. Edge seems biased towards 
the Anglo-Saxon world; at any rate, 
there are surprisingly kw continental 
Europeans or Asians. Brits, on the other 
hand. figure prominently: names that 
stand out include those of Brian Cox, 
Charlie Leadbeater, Colin Blakemore, 
Karl Sabbagh, Martin Rees, Mark Pagel, 
Lewis Wolpert. Patrick Bateson. Simon 
Baron-Cohen. Ross Anderson, Tim 
Demers-Lee and Helena Cronin. 
Asked how he had assembled this 
intriguing posse of thinkers. Brockman 
replied: "It's all based on word of 
mouth and reputation. Edge, contrary 
to how it may appear. is not exclusive. 
Elitist, yes, but in the good sense of an 
open elite, based on meritocracy. The 
way someone is added to the Edge 
list is when I receive a word from a 
Steven Pinker, a Brian Eno, a Martin 
Rees or a Richard Dawkins. telling 
me to do so. It's as simple as that and 
I don't recall ever saying no in such 
circumstances? 
Ever since it appeared online, 
F.dgeorg has consistently been one 
of the most thought-provoking and 
interesting sites on the web. As I write. 
the front-page lead is an extraordinary 
piece by the evolutionary biologist 
Mark Pagel in which he argues that 
humans' capacity• for social learning 
has made us less intelligent than we 
like to think we are. "If I'm living in a 
population of people? he writes, "and 1 
can observe those people, and see what 
they're doing, seeing what innovations 
they're coming up with, 1 can choose 
among the best of those ideas, without 
having to go through the process of 
innovation myself. So, for example. 
if I'm trying to make a better spear, 
I really have no idea how to make 
that better spear. But if I notice that 
somebody else in my society has made 
a very good spear.] can simply copy 
him without having to understand why. 
"What this means is that social 
learning may have set up a situation in 
humans where... we have been selected 
to be very, retyped at copying other 
people, rather than innovating on our 
own. We like to think we're a highly 
inventive, innovative species. But social 
learning means that most of us can 
make use of what other people do and 
not have to invest the time and energy 
in innovation ourselves? 
This essay is a perfect illustration 
of Brockman's idea of what Edge.org 
should do' to serve as a forum for big, 
intriguing and/or disturbing ideas 
advanced by intellectuals who have a 
track record of major achievements in 
their fields. Ile doesn't seem to have 
much time for the scholar who crawls 
along the frontiers of knowledge with a 
magnifying glass. 
This philosophy is also what drives 
one of his annual rituals. Every year, 
on the anniversary of the launch of the 
site, he poses a question and invites 
Edge participants to answer it. 
What kinds of question? "Questions 
that inspire answers we can't possibly 
predict. My goal is to provoke people 
into thinking thoughts they normally 
might not have? In previous years, the 
questions have included: 
What do you believe even though you 
cannot prove it? (2005) 
What is your dangerous idea? (2006) 
What are you optimistic about? (2007) 
What will change everything! (2009) 
In 2010, Brockman's question was: 
"How is the Internet changing the way 
you think?" He received 172 replies 
in the form of mini-essays of varying 
length. These were published on the 
Edge site in the usual way, but 150 of 
them have now been collected between 
hard covers under Brockman's 
editorship. The result: a whopping 
hardback, How is the Internet Changing 
the Way You Think? The Net's Impact 
on Our Minds and Future, published 
last week by Atlantic Books. 
Reading it over Christmas, I was 
intrigued by the book and emailed 
John Brockman to discuss some of 
the thoughts it evoked. What follows is 
an edited transcript of our exchanges.
