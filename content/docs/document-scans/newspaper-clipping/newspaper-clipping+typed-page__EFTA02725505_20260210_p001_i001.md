this crowd and to the book. This 
is interesting because for more 
than a decade his name was barely 
mentioned. He certainly was an 
influence on me in terms of my 
intellectual development and career. In 
one typical conversation, he recounted 
his ideas on how psychoanalysis had 
gone the way of the gods and we 
were in a new realm where we were 
looking at the evolution of patterns and 
information. A lot has been written 
about the differences between atoms 
and bits. but the first time I heard it 
was from Marshall. For anyone who

met him during the 60s, his manner 
and the way in which he presented 
himself were remarkable and never to 
be forgotten. Sitting down at lunch, you 
would be faced with machine gun-like 
expositions of facts and ideas ranging 
from medieval classical literature to 
arcane scientific matters concerning 
the aural space of the native North 
American Eskimos. the focus of the 
work of his collaborator Edmund 
Carpenter. 
It was Carpenter who explained to 
me what he thought was the secret 
behind Marshall's brilliance. At the time, 
the internet, from John Brockman's new book 
know a few basic things about anindivklual 
before meethg him or her. Internet dating 
sites, chanowns,socialnetworkIng sites 
provide these details. enabling the modern 
human brain to pursue more comfort ably 
its ancestraimating dance. 
Then there's the issue of privacy. 
Some are mystified by the way others, 
particularty the young, so frivolously 
reveal their intimate Ives on Facebook, 
Twit ter. in emails and via other internet 
billboards. Yet for millions of years our 
forebears had almost no privacy. With 
the inter net. we are returning to this 
practice of shared communrty. 
So for me. the Internet has only 
magnified — on a grand scale — what I 
already knew about human nature.

The inter net is stealing our attention. It 
competes for It witheverything else we 
do. A lot of what It offers Khigh-purity 
cornoetition But unfortunately a lot of 
what It offers Is merely good at capturing 
ow attention and provides us with little 
of long-term import — sugar-filled 
carbonatedsodas for our mind. 
We, or at least I. need tools that will 
provide us with the Diet-Internet. the 
version that gives us the intellectual 
caffeine that letsus achieve what we 
aspire to. but which doesn't turn us 
into hyperactive intellectual junkies.

The Internet dispenses info, motion the 
way a ketchup bottle dispenses ketchup. 
At first, there was too Ittle: now. there is 
too much. 
In between there was a halcyon interval 
of just -enoughness. For me, it tasted 
about 10 years. 
They were the best years of my life. 
Mcl.uhan was hospitalised after being 
operated on for the removal ofa brain 
tumour. "And all those years we thought 
about the brilliance and we thought it 
was just Marshall," Ted said. "But it was 
the pills he was taking for symptomsof 
what turned out to be the tumour." 
04 I noticed that Martin Rees and 
Richard Dawkins avoided talking 
about themselves and wondered if 
there might be something cultural 
- is British - at work here? I'm an 
Irishman and so can say this! 
`Edge is not for 
everybody. It helps 
to know some 
stuff. But you won't 
find arrogance in 
the responses' 
18 Actually not. In this regard, the 
major challenge is to get ISO to 200 of 
the most brilliant people in the world 
to follow a simple set of guidelines. 
And one of the pronouncements this 
year is: "No anecdotes about spouses. 
significant others, kids, family pets." 
The reason for this prohibition is 
that Edge is a conversation - it's not a 
magazine written for the public. The 
audience for the contributors to Edge 
is the other contributors. The readers 
have the opportunity to look over the 
shoulders of some extraordinarily 
gifted individuals as they go back and 
forth in the battle of ideas. And since 
the scientific method is central to our 
activities, I want to avoid the personal 
and focus on evidence. 
IN I was pleased to sec quite a lot about 
the 'collective IQ" of the net - which is 
something that the mainstream media 
don't seem to understand at all. A 
passage in William Calvin's essay where 
he talks about the net enabling us to 
"stand on the shoulders of a lot more 
giants at the same time- reminded me 
of an older metaphor coined by, I think, 
Doug Engelhart, who invented the 
mouse, windowing interfaces and a lot 
of other seminal computing technology: 
"flower steering for the mind". 
18 One of the concepts that people 
were talking about in the late 60s was 
`thecollective conscious". McLuhan 
made specific reference to it on many 
occasions. Cage used to talk about 
"the mind we all share". The cultural 
anthropologist Edward T Hall, who was 
in that circle, and studied what he called 
the silent languages of rime and space, 
once pointed out tome that our most 
significant, most critical inventions 
were not those ever considered lobe 
inventions, but those that appeared to 
be innate and natural. 
His candidate for the most 
important invention was not the 
capture of fire. not the printing press. 
not the discovery of electricity, not 
the discovery of the structure of 
DNA. Our most important invention 
was.. talking. This was something 
considered innate and natural, 
or actually something that was 
probably never even considered, 
until the first human rendered it 
visible by saying: "We're talking" -
probably an important moment in 
our evolutionary past. 
The internet is such a new 
invention, a code (or the collective 
consciousor "distributed networked 
intelligence". The internet is our 
collective externalised mind. I think 
of it in terms of the concept of feedback: 
the infinite oscillation of our collective 
conscious interacting with itself. 
adding a fuller, richer dimension to 
what it means to he human. 
It's not about computers. It's 
not about what music your friends 
are listening to. It's about human 
communication. "We're talking."
