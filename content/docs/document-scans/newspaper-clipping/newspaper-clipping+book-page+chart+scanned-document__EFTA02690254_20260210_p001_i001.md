Seafood stewardship in crisis 
The main consumer-targeted certification scheme for sustainable fisheries is failing to protect the 
environment and needs radical reform, sayJennifer Jacquet, Daniel Pauly and colleagues. 
A
growing number of consumers want 
to eat seafood without feeling guilty. 
Enter the Marine Stewardship Council 
(MSC), which purports to certify sustainable 
fisheries and provides a label for sustainable 
products to "promote the best environmental 
choice in seafood". The MSC is growing rap-
idly; the organization is also rapidly failing on 
its promise. 
The MSC has become the world's most estab-
lished fisheries certifier: 94 fisheries are cur-
rently MSC-certified, accounting for about 7% 
of global catch, and about 118 more are under 
assessment. MSC-certified seafood products, 
identified with a blue check-mark label, pack 
the shelves of stores such as Wal-Mart, Whole 
Foods Market and Waitrose. Although other 
certification schemes exist, such as Friend 
of the Sea based in Milan, Italy, the MSC is 
taken most seriously by scientists. The MSC is 
praised in Jared Diamond's bookCollapst: How 
Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed(200S), and 
is featured as a solution to declining fish stocks 
in the 2009 film The End of the fine. 
However, objections to MSC certifications 
aregrowing. Scores of scientists (including our-
selves) and many conservation groups, includ-
ing Greenpeacc. the Pew Environment Group 
and some national branches of the WW F. have 
protested over various MSC procedures orcer-
tifications. We believe that, as the MSC increas-
ingly risks its credibility, the planet risks losing 
more wild fish and healthy marine ecosystems. 
This can be turned around only if the MSC 
creates more stringent standards, cracksdown 
on arguably loose interpretation of its rules, 
and alters its process to avoid a potential finan-
cial incentive to certify large fisheries. 
From boat to plate 
Thc MSC, based in London, was founded in 
1997 by the WWF and Unilever. one of the 
world's largest seafood retailers. The MSC 
designed a set of ecological criteria' that had 
the support of many scientists, including 
authors D.P. and S.H., who advised the MSC as 
it was starting up. It abides by three main prin-
ciples. Fisheries must operate so that: fishing 
can continue indefinitely without overexploit-
ing the resources; the productivity of the eco-
system is preserved; and all local, national and 
international laws are upheld. In addition, for a 
product to carry an MSC label, every company 
in the chain from "boat to plate" must be certi-
fied for traceability. The MSC became an inde-
pendent, non-profit organization in 1999. 
From 2000 to 2004, the MSC certified six 
fisheries, which together produced about half 
a million tonnes of seafood annually. The cer-
tification rate has since boomed as commercial 
interest in the scheme rose. In 2006, Wal-Mart 
pledged to sell only MSC-certified wild-capture 
fish in its North American market by 2010. 
Today, MSC certifications cover 6.3 million 
tonnes of seafood per year (see graph).

The MSC had a budget in 2008-09 of £Smil-
lion (US$13 million), mostly from charitable 
donations. To seek certification, a self-defined 
fishery (represented by companies or govern-
ment bodies) chooses an accredited for-profit 
consultancy to perform an assessment. Media 
reports show that the fees are about $15,000-
150,000 per fishery, and about S75,000 for 
annual audits. Accreditation Services Interna-
tional, a company in Bonn. Germany, oversees 
the assessors, who use an open-to-the-public 
system involving independent scientists, input 
from stakeholders and external peer review. 
The process takes months or years and hun-
dreds of documented pages to complete. 
Nevertheless, we have concerns about the 
process. In our view, the certification system 
creates a potential financial conflict of inter-
est, because certifiers that leniently interpret 
existing criteria might expect to receive more 
work and profit from ongoing annual audits. 
Objecting to an assessment comes at a cost: 
up to £15,000 until August 2010, when the 
MSC lowered the maximum fee to £5,000. 
When a formal objection is filed, an independ-
ent adjudicator — a lawyer, rather than a sci-
entist — steps in. The MSC states: "It is not the 
purpose of theObjections Procedure to review 
the subject fishery against the MSC Principles 
and Criteria for Sustainable Fisheries, but to 
determine whether the certification body made 
an error? We feel that this is a mistake. Of the 
four adjudicators appointed by the MSC, only 
two have experience in fisheries management 
mentioned in their MSC biographies. In our 
view, more should be done to ensure that the 
objection process gets to the heart of biological 
issues, rather than bureaucratic ones. 
Generous interpretation 
Some MSC-certified fisheries, such as the one 
for five species of Alaska salmon (Oncorhyn-
chus spp.), do adhere to — or even exceed 
— the principles that underlie the MSC's 
certification scheme. It is our assessment that 
many others do not. 
The largest MSC-certified fishery, with 
an annual catch of I million tonnes, is the 
US trawl fishery for pollock (Themgm chat-
cogramma) in the eastern Bering Sea. It was 
certified in 2005, and recommended for recer-
tification this summer, despite the fact that 
the spawning biomass of those pollock fell by 
64% between 2004 and 2009 (ref. 2). The MSC 
expects the stock to rebound. Similar declines 
in biomass can be found in other MSC fish-
eries. including the Pacific hake (Merluccius 
products), which was certified in 2009 despite 
a population decline of 89% since a peak in 
the late 1980s (ref. 3). Part of the reason for 
this may lie in what we sec as loose wording 
in the MSC criteria. The organization states: 
"for those populations that are depleted, the 
fishery must be conducted in a manner that 
demonstrably leads to their recovery? We 
believe that this needs to change to prevent the 
potential for overly generous interpretations of 
a fishery's future sustainability. Certification 
should not be granted until a fishery is shown 
to be actually sustainable. 
In 2009. the MSC-accredited assessor 
Moody Marine in Derby, UK. recommended 
certification of the Antarctic toothfish (Dissos-
tidtus mawsone), marketed as Chilean sea bass. 
As always, this certification would be subject 
to ongoing monitoring and review. Yet almost
