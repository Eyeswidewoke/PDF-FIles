The Rules for Gluing Massage 
Review these rules before you begin giving a 
massage: 
sot Do no harm: This is the number one rule for 
giving a massage. Refer to Chapter 10 and make 
sure you're aware of the moves that you 
shouldn't make, the places that you shouldn't 
press, and the conditions you shouldn't treat. 
ye Think 3-D: Refer to Chapter 4 and try to visualize 
the invisible physical structures beneath the 
skin that you're affecting with your hands during 
the massage 
so Use your whole body. Remember to use correct 
body mechanics in order to save your own body 
from overexertion while applying just the right 
amount of pressure for your partner. 
to• Focus on the other. This is no time to be thinking 
about politics, sports, the weather, or your 
upcoming turn to receive. As fully as you can, 
focus on your partner, what she's feeling, and 
how you can make her feel better. 
so Go out of your mind: After you figure out the 
moves, practice the technique, and focus on 
your partner with all your concentration, then 
you can stop thinking. Let go of your extraneous 
thoughts — and even your thoughts about doing 
a good job. 
so Get creative: Go ahead, go crazy: just let 
yourself feel whatever you're feeling and go 
with your intuition. As long as what you're doing 
is generated from caring and commitment to 
your partner, it is going to be the right thing. 
so Let love flow Certain people develop an ability 
to send a very distinct and palpable sensation of 
love into their fingers and palms. You can feel it 
when they touch you. Everyone else has the 
potential to develop that ability. Why not use 
massage as an opportunity to explore your own 
innate abilities to send a powerful message of 
caring to others through your touch and 
presence?
