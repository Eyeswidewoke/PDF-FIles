*His Highness is changing his relationship status." 
• 
of every virus on earth—so captivating 
that he once described the world to me 
as a place that consists almost entirely 
of-bacteria, parasites, and viruses," add-
ing that "animals really have to be seen 
as a tiny little addendum." The un-
dergraduate seminar he teaches at Stan-
ford each spring, on the ecological sig-
nificance of microorganisms, is called 
Viral Lifestyles. 
A few decades ago. Wolfe's micro-
bial obsession would have been con-
sidered eccentric. The victory over 
communicable diseases seemed as-
sured. In 1967, William H. Stewart, 
the Surgeon General, told a gathering 
of health experts at the White House, 
"It is time to dose the books on infec-
tious diseases." That statement was 
not wholly without justification. In 
the West, at least, polio, typhoid, chol-
era, even measles—all major killers—
had essentially been vanquished. Small-
pox, which was responsible for the 
deaths of more people than have died 
in any single war, soon disappeared. 
Since then, however, at least fifty 
dangerous new viruses have passed from 
animals into humans. Some are so well 
known that their names are enough to 
make people anxious: Ebola, BARS, 
avian influenza. There are dozens of 
other diseases, like Lassa fever, brought 
• 
on by a disabling hemorrhagic virus first 
discovered in Nigeria two years after 
Stewart's testimony, as well as those 
caused by the Nipah, Hendra, and 
Marburg viruses, which are less fre-
quently mentioned yet just as frighten-
ing. These illnesses are called zoono-
ses—diseases that pass to humans from 
animals. 
Wolfe is determined to break this 
pattern of disease transmission, which 
began ten thousand years ago, with the 
rise of agricultural communities and 
domesticated livestock. In 2008, with 
funding from Google.org, the Skoll 
Foundation, the Department of De-
fense, the National Institutes of Health, 
and others, he founded Global Viral 
Forecasting, with a goal that was both 
remarkably simple and stunningly am-
bitious: to detect pandemics as they 
begin and stop them before they spread. 
Wolfe and his rapidly expanding 
team of researchers have created an ex-
tensive network of viral listening posts 
in the villages of Central Africa, and 
they have compiled a registry of viruses 
in many other places where pandemics 
often start China, Malaysia, Madagas-
car, and Laos. In the past decade, the 
group has collected more than a hun-
dred and fifty thousand blood samples 
from hunters and their families, as 
well as from the animals that they kill, 
butcher, and eat. The scientists screen 
the samples to determine whether any 
humans have been infected with viruses 
that came from animals. Virologists 
refer to the activity of viruses as they 
leap from animal to man as "viral chat-
ter." Wolfe and his colleagues monitor 
samples for early warnings of an epi-
demic, just as, he often says, analysts "at 
the National Security Agency scour the 
Internet, listening for dues of impend-
ing terrorist attacks." 
When Wolfe is in the field, he func-
tions more as an anthropologist than 
as a biologist. The institute tries to keep 
track of hunters in scores of villages 
throughout Cameroon, the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, Gabon, and other 
countries. Outreach teams offer health-
education classes and collect blood and 
tissue samples. This program, called 
Healthy Hunters, is pure social work. It 
isn't easy for a foreigner (or anyone else) 
to tell rural Africans how to conduct 
their lives. Customs vary widely. "On 
one of my first visits to a village site 
in Cameroon, I was with my ex-wife," 
Wolfe recalled recently. "When we ar-
rived, the chief looked at her and asked 
me, '(T eat pour mai?' It took a second 
for me to get what he was asking." 
The team tries to put local scien-
tists out front and never to arrive in a 
village empty-handed. Before we left 
Yaounde, Wolfe helped load a dozen 
soccer balls into the back of a Land 
Cruiser. It is virtually impossible to 
drive by a field in Cameroon without 
seeing a group of boys kicking some-
thing around—fruit, rolled-up wads of 
cotton, sometimes an actual ball. 
Everywhere Wolfe and his col-
leagues go, they stress, in graphic de-
tail, the critical point that primates are 
not for eating. They long ago learned 
not to push or proselytize. Hard sells 
backfire—and usually aren't necessary. 
In Central Africa, where people live in 
wattle huts and dine on bushmeat, 
viruses like Ebola and H.I.V. are not 
vague or distant horrors. They are pres-
ent always, like an endless war, killing 
neighbors and destroying lives. 
The institutes research has yielded 
disturbing results. In October, a group 
that included Wolfe published a re-
port demonstrating that human parvo-
virus 4, which was thought to spread
