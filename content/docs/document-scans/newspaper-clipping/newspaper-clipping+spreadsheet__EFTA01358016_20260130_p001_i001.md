Economic & Asset Class Outlook 
March/April 2016 Outlook 
Near Term 
World economy 
— There are initial signs that U.S. 
manufacturing may be 
stabilizing with several regional 
surveys turning positive. While 
housing data is solid, consumer 
spending has been tepid. 
— In Europe, manufacturing has 
been positive. the labor market 
is improving and personal 
consumption is solid. However, 
geopolitical risks are beginning 
to weigh on sentiment. 
— Slow global growth has weighed 
on manufacturing and business 
confidence in Japan. 
— Emerging markets continue to 
be challenged by slow global 
trade, political headwinds and 
sluggish domestic demand. 
— Tighter financial conditions in 
—
some areas (e.g. U.S.), weak 
global trade and geopolitical 
risks have led us to downgrade 
our 2016 global growth forecast 
(from 3.4% to 3.2%). 
— All developed markets were 
brought lower led by the U.S. 
(from 2.4% to 1.9% in 2016) as 
—
an inventory drawdown, weak 
manufacturing and slow exports 
may weigh on growth this year. 
_ 
— Europe and Japan were 
modestly reduced but 
aggressive central bank policy 
should support growth. 
— EM growth should gradually 
recover as commodity prices 
find a bottom, reforms take hold 
and FX volatility subsides. 
Monetary Policy, Inflation 
and FX 
Bond markets 
- Slower U.S. economic growth 
—
has resulted in the FOMC 
downgrading their outlook on 
growth, inflation and magnitude 
of Fed funds rate hikes in 2016. _ 
— The ECB will likely remain in a 
wait and see mode and let the 
aggressive actions taken at their 
March meeting (e.g. negative 
interest rates, increased OE) 
filter into the economy. 
— The PBOC and BoJ will keep 
-
the door open to take additional 
stimulus measures to support 
growth (e.g. QE. rate cuts). 
- The USD should gain 
momentum vs. the developed 
markets as Fed policy diverges 
from other central banks. 
Ongoing geopolitical risks and 
—
lower growth than originally 
anticipated will likely limit the 
Fed to raise rates one time this 
year (likely June meeting) with 
one post election. This will be 
highly dependant on the outlook 
for growth and inflation. 
A weak Euro and stabilization in 
commodity prices should help 
Europe inflation move higher. 
Growth and interest rate 
differentials and diverging 
monetary policy support the 
dollar long term, especially 
versus the Euro and Yen. 
China and India should remain 
accommodative while Latin 
American countries have less 
flexibility due to high inflation. 
Global bond yields will likely 
remain lower for longer despite 
the Fed's tightening cycle and 
modest pick up in inflation. 
The rise in yields in the near 
term should be limited due to 
low commodity prices, central 
bank QE (ECB and BoJ), 
geopolitical risks (e.g. Brexit) 
and concern over at least a 
modest pullback in risky assets. 
We remain modestly overweight 
high yield but active 
management is recommended. 
We remain underweight EM 
debt due to uncertain economic 
fundamentals. volatile 
currencies and heavy USD 
denominated debt burdens. 
The rise in long term yields over 
the next 12 mos will likely be 
muted as moderate inflation, a 
'slow' Fed tightening cycle and 
aggressive stimulus from the 
ECB and BoJ keep global 
sovereign yields contained. 
We recommend a modest short 
duration to the benchmark due 
to the expectation of modestly 
higher yields in the long run. 
Focus on select credit (e.g. IG 
and high yield). History 
suggests credit outperforms 
sovereigns in tightening cycles. 
Cautious on EM debt due to the 
uncertain growth outlook but 
looking for opportunities to add. 
Active management advised, 
especially in high yield.

Equity markets 
- Most global Indices have rallied 
10%4- since their Feb. lows. As 
a result, valuations look 
stretched, technicals are 
approaching overbought 
territory and near term caution 
may be warranted. 
- We reduced our weighting to 
global equities by lowering the 
U.S. (still overweight) and 
Europe (to neutral). 
- Still favor OM vs. EM. 
- In the near term, global equities 
may be challenged by weak 
earnings, geopolitical risks and 
stretched valuations. 
- Favor select cyclicals over 
defensives. 
- In EM favor Asia over Latam. 
- Over the next 12 months, 
equities should be supported by 
improving eamings growth, 
modest economic growth and 
accommodative central banks. 
- However, heightened volatility 
will offer tactical opportunities to 
adjust positions (e.g. regions, 
sectors) as warranted. 
- As the economic cycle matures 
(especially in U.S.). retums 
should be driven by dividends, 
buybacks and earnings growth. 
- Favor DM over EM due to more 
attractive fundamentals, better 
earnings visibility and greater 
monetary policy flexibility. 
- In EM, favor Asia vs. Latam due 
to more attractive fundamentals 
and policy flexibility. 
Alternatives and 
Commodities 
— With oil production continuing to 
come down (rig count near 
seven year low) and the dollar 
remaining under pressure. 
prices have been able to find 
near term stability. 
— However, it is too early to 
suggest the bottom in oil prices 
is behind us. Oil prices will likely 
be challenged in the near term 
as the dollar gains strength and 
the ongoing supply/demand 
imbalance remains. 
- Gold has been supported by 
geopolitical events, aggressive 
central bank actions and slower 
Fed rate hikes. 
- Increased volatility to favor 
select hedge funds. 
- The combination of heightened 
volatility, over supply and 
stronger dollar keeps us 
underweight commodities. 
— However, an expectation for 
better global growth (in 2016) 
and likely production cuts 
should support a modest rise in 
oil prices over the next 12 
months (Mar 2017 target=350) . 
— Another way to complement 
commodity exposure is through 
investments less sensitive to the 
price of oil (e.g. MLPs, oil 
transportation 8 storage). 
— We favor hedge funds with a 
focus on equity market neutral. 
These should benefit from 
dispersion within equity sectors 
and regions.
