Moving back to risk-on? Beware the law of unintended consequences. 
The first halt of 2015 was a turbulent ono. In the first few 
months, Russia, the Ukraine and Brazil were in the headlines, as 
were commodity prices and the abandonment of the EUR/CHF 
peg. The second quarter was then dominated by the Greek crisis 
and China. U.S. Treasury and Bund yields hit new lows in April 
before increasing significantly and causing negative absolute 
returns. Credit spreads widened. Volatility increased. 
As we move into the second half of the year, some of those 
geopolitical issues seem to be almost miraculously resolved.
Greece appears willing to accept the tough conditions required 
by its creditors. China has halted the sell-off in its equity markets. 
An unexpected bonus has been a sanctions-lifting deal with Iran. 
This leaves the timing of the first Fed hike as the key source of 
near-term uncertainty But, with most agreeing that it will be, in 
September or December and that the pace of hiking will be slow, 
the possibility for upset appears limited. 
In this environment, we believe that it may be appropriate' 
to start re-entering into some riskier positions in high-yield 
(excluding energy), euro investment-grade and emerging-market 
sovereigns. We are not overly concerned about an immediate 
sharp sell-off in rates as lower commodity prices should keep 
inflation expectations contained. 
But any sense of calm could be deceptive. Big differences of 
opinion between Eurozone member states about the nature of 
monetary union remain. As their market intervention reminded 
us, the Chinese authorities also still do not really trust free 
markets, which may have implications on foreign investment. 
Another topic which needs to be closely monitored relates to the 
unintended consequences of regulatory restrictions. Note, for 
example. Value-at-Risk (VaR) limits. These have to be followed 
by trading desks and various institutional investors. Rising VaR 
Not suitable for all investors. Potential investors should seek 
professional financial advice before investing. 
therefore leads to lower level of risk appetite and can turn into 
lower trading activity and exacerbate price movements — not 
what was intended. 
The chart shows the German sovereign-bond VaR since 2000. 
Note the recent sharp increase in VaR to a multi-decade high. 
Rising VaR may have led to a lack of demand for German 
sovereign bonds in late April and early May, perhaps contributing 
to a sharp rise in Bund yields. As this shows, a decent risk-
management approach which considers the possible impact of 
such factors remains highly important.

In late April and early May German sovereign-bond VaR rose 
to a multi-decade. Rising VaR may have been linked to a lack
