FROM THE TRENCHES 
by Dave Cummings 
What's up with the choking, slapping, spitting, 
and rough sex in some porn releases? And, 
those oral sex gaggings! What's sensuous about 
it? What's sexy about it? What message might 
some viewers, especially guys, possibly/wrongly 
assume from seeing such aberrations in adult 
films and mistakenly rationalize it as normal or 
OK, and later try to copycat it into their own sexual relationships? 
Now, I admit that I've heard lots of women on sets and in the 
swinging world comment about the joy and pleasure they get from 
being "taken", or "dominated", or made to "subordinate" them-
selves to the pleasures of their guy; I respect their choices and 
right to participate in such sexual practices, but I sometimes won-
der if perhaps some of these ladies think (or were pushed to think?) 
that they truly enjoy handing over sexual control, when unfortu-
nately some of them might possibly suffer from low self-esteem or 
some other disorder, or from a persistence from a 
husband/boyfriend who's seen such acts in some adult films and 
has pushed them into it. I think such women in society are in an 
extremely low percentage relative to females who might want just 
a good hard pounding during sex, or a good old-fashion sweat 
filled sex-fun time; or, women who want sex and love-making to be 
intermingled within their intimate and behind-closed-doors ses-
sions with their mate. I'm worried, though, that companies high-
lighting such "rough" behaviors see enough patronage sales that 
they will continue putting out such content, possibly "raising" new 
viewers to expect their future sexual partners to welcome the fan-
tasy depicted on film. Male teens growing into manhood and view-
ing such acts possibly don't easily realize that what they view on 
their screens are actors/actresses and consenting adults "acting" 
and depicting fantasy, not normal reality! I hope such releases 
aren't inviting, indeed pushing, future government intervention 
into our First Amendment rights. And, I certainly hope we don't 
have a terrible accident someday on a set and end up with a chok-
ing "act" mistakenly ending in an injury or death. If I personally 
could wave a magic wand, it would be for all adult video producers 
to cease depicting the aforementioned. As a viewer, I want to see 
sexy couplings that sexually turn me on, not unrealistic physical 
acts of an almost-violent nature that disgusts me, as it probably 
also does to many other viewers and potential customers. 
What I opined above has been on my mind for a long time. I've 
anguished over it, and I hope that things significantly improve. 
What's been released in the past hasn't been unlawful, but I also 
worry that some of it hasn't been very responsible either, or good 
counsel for some impressionable viewers. I think our right to free 
speech also encompasses a responsibility on our part to foster 
good, respectful, and proper behaviors. Just like it's wrong to 
falsely scream "fire" in a crowded theater, I feel that it's wrong to 
portray sexually aberrant depictions as anything but abnormal fan-
tasy---NOT reality! 
Speaking of our right to make and view adult films, the recent 
Free Speech Coalition's annual lobbying seminar and appointments 
with legislators and staff personnel at the California Legislature in 
Sacramento was another resounding success. The Free Speech 
Coalition officials are super-smart folks, dedicated to head off 
potential problems before they become law. The four Industry folks 
on my team, including actress Mari Vachs, found that we were truly 
welcome in the legislator's offices, not just tolerated. Heck, it 
seems that even Government people have the natural, normal, and 
healthy sexual needs that the citizenry has! Along with a plethora 
of Industry personnel, the other actresses on teams addressing 
issues with legislators included Nina Hartley, Stormy, Sunny Leone, 
and Brittany Andrews. 
Lots of shoots this past month! I especially enjoyed Wildlife's 
"Screw My Wife, Please, Vol 48" in which I got oral sex from each 
and every wife in the film. Yup, I'm a pervert! I'm hearing that Vol 
50, which will be filmed the month after next, will be especially 
sex-filled and special. I think getting to 50 volumes is quite an 
accomplishment, and a special salute to Director Bobby Rinaldi; I 
look forward to working towards 100 volumes of it! 
I wish a super-nice summer for everyone, one filled with hap-
piness, good health, and great SEX!!!!!

Hey everyone. Is it as hot where you are as it 
is in So Cal? 
May brought us the adult expo in Nev. 
York City and June features the three-day 
Erotica L.A. With more and more of these 
industry events popping up throughout the 
year, fans should be able to see their favorite 
cock suckers....errrr adult film stars without having to come to 
Vegas in January. Since the XRCO Awards has actually been moved 
back to spring we can officially close the book on the 20O4 awards 
season before we officially enter the second half of 2005. It would 
be nice to get these things done before it's time to start compiling 
lists for the New Year. 
It was a very good month for Seymore Butts. As his successful 
show "Family Business" wrapped up season three, Showtime 
announced that they would pick up the reality-based program for a 
forth season. The good news comes at a time when the ratings for 
"Family Business" have never been higher. 
Thomas Zupko didn't need to be a free agent for long before 
Landing a big time job. The award-winning director has been chosen 
to direct flicks for Hustler. He will be back doing what he does best, 
shootin features for the first time since his ground-breaking 
"Opera' was released by Elegant Angel. Working under the VCA 
label for Hustler, Zupko will release his first movie "Butt BIASSted" 
later this summer. In addition to the features, Zupko plans to shoot 
gonzo for Hustler's other lines to spread his talents around. In a 
related story, the award-winning director has coaxed one of porn's 
hottest babes back in front of the camera. Filming in early June 
"The Obsessions of Avy Scott" will star the busty babe with the 
killer butt in a number of scenes. Zupko was mum on the details, 
but knowing these two, it is bound to be something magically Ass-
licious. 
If the last story and history mean anything at all, Kami Andrews 
may have a future at Hustler. Like Zupko she worked for Extreme, 
though her tenure there was brief. Unlike Zupko, Kami looks good 
in a thong, but that's another story. Now she has signed on to be 
the newest director for Elegant Angel. Known for her high-energy 
scenes Kami is the kind of girl who can get the most out of female 
talent. Not one to the take the easy way out, Kami plans to do the 
hard work required to produce a high quality stroke flick. "A lot of 
companies take a porn starlet and slap her name on it as director to 
move product," says Kami. 'Elegant Angel is not one of those com-
panies. They have met with me to try to understand my vision and 
even requested a sample scene to make sure I wasn't just talking 
the talk!' 
Vivid just keeps adding names to their roster. Their latest con-
tract girl is brunette model and Penthouse Pet Sunny Leone. The 
twenty-three year old beauty was born in Canada and is the first 
Vivid Girl of Indian decent. Though Sunny has been doing adult 
modeling since she turned eighteen, this will be her first foray into 
hard-core sex on camera. After five years as a very popular model 
Sunny wanted something more. "I wanted to sign with a company 
that would really help me advance, so I chose Vivid to help me take 
this bi  step in my life because you only get one chance to make a 
debut,' says Ms. Leone. 
Finally friends I leave you with the two most compelling ques-
tions in Porn Valley this month. Where are the Kerkoves? Is Teagan 
Pregnant? The first is a somewhat disturbing situation that has blos-
somed over the past few weeks. It seems that no one had heard 
from either Skeeter or Bridgette in a few months. Their usually 
active web site and Yahoo group have gone quiet and no one can 
explain it. Hopefully they are just taking a well-deserved break from 
the busy schedule and enjoying the family life. As for Teagan's pos-
sible pregnancy, there isn't much word there either. No one will 
confirm or deny the existence of a child so we're left with all sorts of 
wild rumors about who the father might be. I hate to speculate, so 
we can just let the silence speak for itself for now. 
Late breaking news: I just got word that Sin City and Aurora have 
parted ways. Sin City announced the end of the two-year relation-
ship in a press release that also indicated that Shay Sweet's contract 
has not been renewed. The move puts both women on the market 
and leaves Aurora free to work for anyone she pleases. Shay will still 
work with Sin City on a project by project basis, but there is no indi-
cation that we will see Aurora in any Sin City or Mayhem movies 
again. (Until the comps start coming out anyway.)
