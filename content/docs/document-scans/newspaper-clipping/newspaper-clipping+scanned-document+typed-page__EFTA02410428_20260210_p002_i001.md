The world over. All cultures have religious beliefs, 
though they express them in diverse ways. 
Twenty thousand years later, humans 
reached another religious milestone, build-
ing what is often considered the world's first 
temple at the I I ,000-year-old site of 
2 
g Gobekli Tepe in Turkey (Science, 18 January 
W ig 2008, p. 278).There, rows of standing stones 
s up to 6 meters tall march down a high hill-
side in circles; each massive stone is carved 
: with images of wild animals. "There is the 
/ erection of monumental and megalithic 
I architecture for the first time." says excava-
'4'. tor Klaus Schmidt of the German Archaeo-
logical Institute in Berlin. 
After this time, more organized sites with 
apparently religious aspects appear else-
T where. For example, at one of the first set-
a tied towns, Catalhoy0k in southern TbrkeY, 
1 excavator Ian Hodder of Stanford University 
14' and his crew are finding what they consider 
: copious evidence of spiritual life: feasts with 
g wild bulls, burials of ancestors beneath 
houses, and sometimes the removal and 
Z reinterment of skulls. And yet Hodder notes 
1 that separating "religion" from other activi-
; ties seems arbitrary, as it is not clear that the 
$ people of Catalh0yiik themselves 
• separated the religious sphere

s from the rest of life. 
Renfrew cautions that it 
might not be possible to know 
E for sure that a culture wor-
shipped gods until we can read 
their names—that is, until the 
literate societies of ancient 
Mesopotamia and Egypt, 
g some 5000 years ago. Those 
2 early empires had both seen-
1
 lar and religious hierarchies, 
with priestly elites and some-
times a god-king who ruled both 
i the temporal and spiritual 
2 realms. In this view, full-fledged 
t • "religion" develops hand in hand 
g with organized social hierarchies. It 
; may be that "you don't necessarily 
• have belief in deities until you have persons of 
I
enormously high status, who themselves are 
close to divine," like a pharaoh. says Renfrew. 
Born believers? 
While archaeologists trace the outward 
expressions of religious and symbolic behav-
ior. another group of researchers is trying to 
trace more subtle building blocks of religious 
belief, seeking religion's roots in our minds. 
"You begin to see that a god is a 
likely thing fin' a human mind 
to construct." 
According to the emerging cognitive 
model of religion, we are so keenly attuned to 
the designs and desires of other people that 
we arc hypersensitive to signs of "agents": 
thinking minds like ow own. In what anthro-
pologist Pascal Boyer of Washington Univer-
sity in St. Louis in Missouri has described as 
a "hypertrophy of social cognition:" we tend 
to attribute random events or natural phe-

Signs of the spirit? Small, 30,000-year-old fig-
urines from Germany suggest religious 
nomcna to the agency of anothcr being. 
When it comes to natural phenomena. "we 
may be intuitive theists," says cognitive psy-
chologist Deborah Kelemcn of Boston Uni-
versity (BU). She has shown in a series of 
papers that young children prefer "teleologi-
cal:' or purpose-driven, expla-
nations rather than mechanical 
ones for natural phenomena. 
For example, in several 
studies British and American 
children in first, second, and 
Deborah heligium• fourth grades wcrc asked 
liositill 
I ui'eisitr whether rocks arc pointy 
because they are composed of 
small bits of material or in order to keep ani-
mals from sitting on them. The children pre-
ferred the teleological explanation. "They 
give an animistic quality to the rock; it's pro-
tecting itself:" Kelemen explains. Further 
studies have confirmed this tendency. Even 
Kelemen's own son—who "gets mechanistic 
explanations of everything"—is not immune: 
At age 3, after hearing how flowers grow 
from sccds, his question was, "Who makes 
the seeds'?" 
The point of studying children is that 
they may better reflect innate rather than 
cultural biases, says Kelemen. But recent 
work suggests that it's not just children: 
Kelemen and Krista Casler of Franklin & 
Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylva-
nia, found the same tendency to ascribe pur-
pose to phenomena like rocks, sand, and 
lakes in uneducated Romany adults. They 
also tested BU undergraduates who had 
taken an average of three college science 
classes. When the undergrads had to 
respond under time pressure, they were 
likely to agree with nonscientific statements 
such as "The sun radiates heat because 
warmth nurtures life:' 
"It's hard work to overcome these teleo-
logical explanations," says Kelemen, who 
adds that the data also suggest an uphill 
battle for scientific literacy. "When you 
speed people up, their hard work goes by 
the wayside." She's now investigating how 
professional scientists perform on her tests. 
Such purpose-driven beliefs are a step on 
the way to religion, she says. "Things exist
