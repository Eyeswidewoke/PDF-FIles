that happen, ever. It really wasn't my fault, 
but I don't want to blame her either. She 
certainly didn't mean for it to happen. Let's 
just say that I came up with the concept 
that drunk people and fires don't mix that 
weal. 1 don't know if 1 will ever do a fire 
show again. And if I do it won't be for a 
while. My burns are healing very nicely and 
I went to the doctor who gave me cream 
and she said it should be fine and it's not 
going to scar. 
X: When did this all happen? 
T: About four weeks. 
X: I'm wry. I was told you had this great 
story about your ass catching on fire, and I 
thought it was supposed to be funny. That 
isn't funny. 
T: It's not too funny. But I probably made 
it sound funny, because people really freak 
out when they hear it. So I tell it in a 
humorous sort of way. I say, "I looked 
down and all of a sudden, Holy Shit, my ass 
is on fire!" It's not funny, but it is kind of 
ra 
funny. 
X: Well after you are all better, you will 
probably tell it funny. 
T: And afterward everyone was saying here 
have a shot of tequila, have a shot, to try 
and forget the pain. By the end of the 
night I was shaking, I kind of went into a 
little bit of shock. I was lucky; it could have 
been my face or my hair. All those girls out 
there, be careful with your fire shows! 
X: What is the funniest thing that over hap-
pened to you when you were featuring? 
1: Oh God. My girlfriend hates to travel 
with me. She used to call my Grace, 
because I used to be anything but graceful. 
A lot of people tell me I am graceful on 
stage but really I am a total klutz. Probably 
the funniest thing that ever happened to 
me was I was doing a Mick and my shoe 
flew off and hit a guy in the face. He was 
laughing about it and I was embarrassed 
but it was funny at the same time. 
X: What is the weirdest thing a fan ever 
said to you? 
T: A guy asked me if I would piss in a cup 
so he could drink it. 
X: You should have said how much money 
do you have in your bank account? 
T: I didn't do it. It's a little out there for 
me. I don't' put you down for it though if 
you are into that, that's great. Whatever 
gets you off. 
X: What does your ideal man look like? 
T: I've dated every type of archetype, they 
say there are 21 archetypes of humans, and 
I've probably dated one of each. From 
completely nerdy, the artist, the rocker, the 
athletic person. I'm very into fitness. I like 
a guy, he doesn't have to be huge or a 
body builder, but a nice looking guy that I 
can tell takes care of himself, that has a 
nice head of hair because I love to run my 
fingers through a man's hair. Beautiful 
eyes, piercing eyes are always a good 
thing. And teeth, ya gotta have a nice 
smile. 
X: Yeah, it wouldn't be fun dating a 
guy with no teeth! (Laughs) 
T: I've gotta tell you and I'm not 
going to tell you where, but I was 
just at a club where a lot of people 
were missing teeth. And I have to 
tell you I don't know how they walk 
around thinking that it's okay. It's 
NOT OKAY! I don't care if you get 
fake teeth; get something to fill 
those spaces! Oh my God, you don't 
have the nicest body, or nicest face, 
but if you have nice teeth I'll take
