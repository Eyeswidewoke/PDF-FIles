| **Organized Location** | `_ORGANIZED/03-Emails/epstein-maxwell/DS9/` |

### Summary
**Mike Sitrick** (crisis PR specialist) emails Epstein about the Daily Mail article titled "GHISLAINE HAS FEMALES FOR MR SE". Sitrick is coordinating with Epstein's legal team including **Dershowitz, Weinberg, Knight, and Lefkowitz**.

Draft press statement prepared by the team:
> *"the government did not charge, nor were there ever allegations that Jeffrey Epstein was a pedophile."*

### Epstein's Defense (verbatim)
> "also the she has females was a message from the local massage parlor. not from ghislaine"

> "The fourteen year old told the police that she swore she was 18, and that mr epstein would not let anyone in the house who was not."

### Why This Matters
- Shows Epstein actively managing media narrative with a professional crisis PR firm
- The draft statement's careful wording — technically the plea deal was for solicitation, not pedophilia
- Epstein's personal defense: blaming a "massage parlor" for the "she has females" message, claiming the 14-year-old lied about her age
- Full legal team coordination visible: Dershowitz, Weinberg, Knight, Lefkowitz all involved
