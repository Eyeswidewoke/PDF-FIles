### Summary
The Daily Mail article text is embedded in the email chain (Finding #4). It reports on telephone message logs from Epstein's "Florida child sex den":

From the article:
> *"Ghislaine Maxwell… is apparently implicated in the procurement of masseuses. She once called to say: 'She has females for Mr JE.'"*

> *"a message from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just did a good one — 18 years. (She spoke to me and said, "I love Jeffrey")'."*

> *"One message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.' It was left in February 2005"*

> *"The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends including the business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein, magician David Copperfield"*

### Epstein's Defense
See Finding #4. Claims the "she has females" message was from a "local massage parlor, not from Ghislaine."
