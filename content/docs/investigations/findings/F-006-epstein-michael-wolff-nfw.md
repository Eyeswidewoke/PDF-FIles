| **Recipient** | Michael Wolff |
| **Subject** | Fwd: fact checking questions for New York Magazine story |

### Summary
**Alex Yablon** from New York Magazine sends detailed fact-checking questions to Epstein for an upcoming story. Epstein forwards the entire email to **Michael Wolff** (journalist/author, later wrote "Fire and Fury" about Trump) with a single word: **"nfw"** (no fucking way).

### Key Fact-Checking Questions Asked
- *"do you advise the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on how to convince other billionaires to join their initiatives?"*
- *"did you volunteer to invest $20 million dollars in Michael's attempt to buy New York Magazine in 2004?"*
- *"do you believe the recent claims about Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew in relation to you are 'ludicrous'?"*
- *"Do you have a support staff of young women in their 20s and 30s?"*
- *"Did you date Eva Andersson Dubin? Have you known her for 30 years? Did you pay for her to go to medical school?"*
- Questions about properties in New Mexico, Paris, Palm Beach, the Caribbean
- Questions about a "current girlfriend" who is a "dental student"

### Why This Matters
- Epstein's relationship with Michael Wolff — close enough to forward sensitive media inquiries
- The Gates Foundation question confirms journalists were investigating the Epstein–Gates connection as early as 2015
- "nfw" response suggests Epstein and Wolff had a shared understanding about media strategy
- Eva Andersson Dubin connection (wife of Glenn Dubin, hedge fund manager)
- Multiple email addresses visible: `jeevacation@gmail.com`, `leevacation@gmail.com` (OCR variants)
