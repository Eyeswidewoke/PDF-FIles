| **Sources** | `EFTA00425993`, `EFTA00748155`, `EFTA02505598`, `EFTA01746635`, `EFTA00347549`, `EFTA00459584`, `EFTA00407158`, `EFTA01179636`, `EFTA00492020` |
| **Datasets** | Primarily DS9, DS10, DS11 |
| **Categories** | `03-Emails/scheduling-travel`, `03-Emails/personal`, `07-Communications/text-messages` |
| **Focus** | Day-to-day mechanics: pickups, model routing, visas, apartment operations, air/ground fallback, wire-funded travel, passport scheduling |

### Summary
Targeted follow-up reads for Investigation B surfaced a coherent operations chain across multiple years: transport coordination, model-routing instructions, visa support language, apartment servicing/move-out logistics tied to MC2/Brunel, and urgent payment execution for flights and ground transfer.

### Key Quotes (verbatim from documents)

From `EFTA00425993` (DS9):
> "You are to take her to next modeling agency. Please confirm these changes!"

> "check in with me before picking up Daniella... [she] is not supposed to go to NExt Modeling Agency from the airport..."

From `EFTA00748155` (DS9):
> "I have some girls in mind for your job, but none has a visa..."

> "do you want to do it? otherwise i can help with their visas"

From `EFTA02505598` / `EFTA01746635` (DS11/DS10):
> "jean luc brunet appt access"

> "Please let me know, if we can send the maid."

> "blank move-out form for 301 e 66th st, nyc 10065 ... scheduled for Monday the 13th of april"

From `EFTA00347549` / `EFTA00459584` (DS9):
> "Need JE car upon arrival., No helicopter today,. Since (Heli is in Fort Lauderdale for annual inspection.,)"

> "No helicopter today. JE will have to be picked up by vehicle"

From `EFTA00407158` / `EFTA01179636` (DS9):
> "Payment of services for Aug. 4- need wired asap"

> "we still haven't seen any payment for the plane ... and the ground transportation"

From `EFTA00492020` (DS9):
> "You have an appointment tomorrow ... at the Passport Agency in West Palm..."

> "Should I change Jeffrey's flight to Tues. March 12?"

### Why This Matters
- Moves beyond high-level allegations to repeated, concrete operational instructions.
- Links scheduling staff, travel handlers, and finance coordination in the same workflow.
- Shows documented fallback behavior (helicopter unavailable -> vehicle pickup) and rapid payment execution for transport.
- Adds process-level evidence not previously captured in the original 15 findings.
