### Summary
At least **two versions** of draft PR/media statements prepared by or for Ghislaine Maxwell, found across multiple pages of the same source document.

### Version 1 — Meeting Virginia at Mar-a-Lago
Maxwell's account of meeting Virginia Roberts:
- Claims she met Virginia at **Mar-a-Lago**
- *"she said she was a masseuse"*
- *"Prince Andrew came to my house to visit me — [Virginia] was in the house and they did meet"*
- Denies knowledge of any sexual activity involving Andrew, Dershowitz, or Clinton

### Version 2 — Attacking Virginia's Credibility
Different tone, attacks Virginia Roberts:
- Claims Virginia *"was working as a waitress in a burger bar when she left the country after being arrested for stealing 300 dollars in tips"*
- References attorneys **Rothstein** and **Edwards**
- Appears to be a more aggressive PR strategy
