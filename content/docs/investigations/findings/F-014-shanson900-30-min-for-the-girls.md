## 14. Shanson900 — "30 min for the girls"

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source PDF** | `EFTA01854575.pdf` |
| **Dataset** | DS10 |
| **Date** | July 26, 2014 |
| **Category** | `07-Communications/text-messages` |

### Summary
Text from **Shanson900** (Steve Hanson — see email headers) to Epstein:
> *"30 min for the girls. 292 gerard drive. East hampton"*

Epstein forwards to **Steve Hanso[n]** and writes:
> *"Steve I will lock everything up well, key under pot?"*

### Why This Matters
- **"30 min for the girls"** at a specific East Hampton address is deeply suggestive
- Same sender "Shanson900" as Finding #8 ("Trump's going to win")
- Identity now partially resolved: **Steve Hanson** — appears to be a close associate with access to Epstein's properties
- Pattern of Epstein using East Hampton properties (292 Gerard Drive) for meetings involving "girls"
- The casual tone and key-under-pot arrangement suggests routine activity
