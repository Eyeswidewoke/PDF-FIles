### Summary
Epstein emails his full legal team — **Lefkowitz, Weinberg, Roy Black, Dershowitz, Indyke** — cc'ing **Sitrick** (PR) and **Goldberger**:

> *"Roy has the best feel. He is team leader. He has the respect of the local judges prosecutors etc. He gets to decide."*

Mentions **"South Florida, Marie, Acosta, Ferrar"** — key actors in the plea deal.

### Why This Matters
- Epstein directly managing his own legal strategy, choosing Roy Black as point person
- Name-drops **Acosta** (the US Attorney who gave the sweetheart plea deal, later Trump's Labor Secretary)
- "Marie" likely refers to Assistant US Attorney Marie Villafaña who handled the case
- Shows Epstein's confidence in his legal team's relationships with local judiciary
