### Summary
Email from **Geoffrey Berman** (USANYS — US Attorney for SDNY) forwarding/discussing press coverage. Berman is the US Attorney who indicted Epstein in 2019. A journalist asks why **three successive DOJ administrations** (Bush, Obama, Trump) protected **Prince Andrew**, and why the DOJ granted immunity to procurers — explicitly naming **Ghislaine Maxwell**.

The communications version (EFTA00016124, score=92) references: epstein, trump, clinton, andrew with location/activity/financial/legal keywords.

### Why This Matters
- The prosecutor who brought the 2019 case was receiving pointed questions about systemic DOJ protection of Andrew
- Raises the question of why immunity was granted to Maxwell and other procurers in the original plea deal
- Three administrations spanning both parties implicated in protecting Andrew
