### Summary
FBI Child Exploitation Task Force internal email chain. An FBI agent interviews **Sergio Cordero** (modeling agent and business partner of Jean-Luc Brunel) and reports findings to FBI supervisors.

### Key Quotes (verbatim from document)

> "Cordero confirmed that Brunel uses MC2 as a legitimate transport agency of underage girls into America for purposes of sex."

> "Brunel uses MC2 to introduce underage girls to Epstein since Epstein gave him $1 million dollars to start up MC2 after he was fired from various modeling agencies in Paris"

> "Brunel has always been Epstein's principal supplier of underage girls using MC2 as a cover up"

> "Many of the underage girls that Brunel and Epstein shared and liked continue to live in Brunel's 1 bedroom apt in NY… There are some underage girls living there now." *(Written in 2010!)*

> "Cordero confirmed that former President Clinton was on Epstein's plane with Brunel several times with underage girls. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS HEAR SAY SINCE HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT HE WAS NOT THERE. Cordero stated that Brunel told him this information."

> "Epstein's HOUSE MANAGER ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ was ARRESTED FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE on 11/09 — for attempting to sell notebook (the golden nugget), to an undercover agent for $50K. That notebook contained and confirmed all allegations and had photos, emails and notes outlining Epstein and Brunel's sex trafficking scheme."

### Follow-up from FBI Supervisor (June 11, 2010, p003)
> "I talked to SSA [redacted] who is the supervisor for the crimes against children squad here. He advised that he would like to interview Sergio Cordero… He said that Mr. Cordero will be told upfront that after the initial interview by us, he will be put into a grand jury to testify about the information he is airing."

### Why This Matters
- FBI agents explicitly documenting MC2 as a sex trafficking front, not just a modeling agency
- Corroboration of Clinton on Epstein's plane (hearsay, noted as such by FBI agent)
- Confirms the "golden nugget" notebook was real and contained comprehensive evidence
- Written in 2010 — shows FBI had this information years before the 2019 SDNY indictment
- Grand jury testimony was being arranged for Cordero
