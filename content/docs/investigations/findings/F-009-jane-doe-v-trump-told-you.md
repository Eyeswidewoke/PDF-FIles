### Summary
Two emails sent by Epstein within 6 minutes of each other on the evening of November 4, 2016 — **4 days before the presidential election**.

**Email 1 (EFTA02447591, 10:18 PM) — To Kathy Ruemmler:**
> From: Jeffrey E. `<jeevacation@gmail.com>`
> To: Kathy Ruemmler
> Subject: **told you**

Epstein forwards the automated PACER notification of Jane Doe's voluntary dismissal (Case 1:16-cv-07673-RA, Doe v. Trump et al).

**Email 2 (EFTA02447641, 10:24 PM) — To unknown recipient:**
> From: Jeffrey E. `<jeevacation@gmail.com>`
> Subject: **told you, the case ws a fake**

Same PACER notification forwarded, with Epstein adding: **"the case ws a fake"**

### Why This Matters
- Epstein was actively tracking the Jane Doe v. Trump case
- **TWO separate emails** — one to Ruemmler, another to someone else — show Epstein broadcasting the dismissal
- "told you" implies Epstein had previously predicted or discussed the case's outcome with Ruemmler
- **"the case ws a fake"** — Epstein's own characterization of the Jane Doe allegations against Trump
- **Kathy Ruemmler** is a significant figure: Obama White House Counsel, later met with Epstein multiple times (reported by NYT)
- The timing — **4 days before the 2016 presidential election** — is politically explosive
- The case alleged Trump and Epstein sexually assaulted a 13-year-old; it was voluntarily dismissed, plaintiff claimed threats
- Combined with Finding #8 ("Trump's going to win"), shows Epstein was deeply engaged with the 2016 election

### Action Items
- [ ] Locate exact source PDF during full scan
- [ ] Search for other Ruemmler correspondence in the files
- [ ] Check if there are earlier emails where Epstein discusses this case ("told you" implies prior conversation)
