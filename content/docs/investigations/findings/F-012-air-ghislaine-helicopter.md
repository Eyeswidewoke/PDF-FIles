| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source PDF** | `EFTA01117570.pdf` |
| **Dataset** | DS9 |
| **Date** | August 3, 2009 |
| **Category** | `11-Case-Evidence/people/maxwell` |

### Summary
Official **Sikorsky Aircraft System Specification** document for:
> **"Air Ghislaine 2"** — S-76C++ Aircraft — DELUXE EXECUTIVE CONFIGURATION
> System Specification SYS76-00121, "Air Ghislaine Rev C"
> Customer: Air Ghislaine 2

This is a corporate helicopter specification document. Additional mentions found:
- **"Air Ghislaine, Inc."** organizational file linked to **"Shmitka Air, Inc"** and **"Freedom Air"** (`EFTA00298018`)
- **"AIR GHISLAINE, INC"** corporate records (`EFTA01481382`)

### Why This Matters
- Epstein naming aircraft after Maxwell underscores the depth of their relationship
- **S-76C++** is a luxury helicopter (cost ~$13-15 million)
- The "Inc." designation and connection to "Shmitka Air" and "Freedom Air" shows shell company structure for aircraft
- Even post-conviction (2008), Epstein maintained luxury aircraft operations — this spec is dated August 2009
- "Air Ghislaine" could be cross-referenced with flight logs and FAA records

### Action Items
- [ ] Locate exact source PDF during full scan
- [ ] Cross-reference tail number "576C++" with FAA records
- [ ] Check if this helicopter appears in flight logs alongside the "Lolita Express"
