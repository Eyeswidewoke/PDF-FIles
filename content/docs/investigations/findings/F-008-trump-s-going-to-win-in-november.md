### Summary
Text message from **"Shanson900"** to Epstein:

> *"Trumps going to win in November. When are u in NYC"*

### Why This Matters
- Places Epstein in active political conversations during the 2016 election
- Shows someone in Epstein's circle was confident of Trump's victory 6 months before the election
- Identity of "Shanson900" unknown — could be significant
- Paired with Finding #9 (Jane Doe v. Trump), shows Epstein tracking Trump-related legal matters

### Action Items
- [ ] Identify "Shanson900" — check phone records, contact lists
- [ ] Look for other 2016 election-related communications
