## 1. FBI Internal Email: Brunel/MC2 Sex Trafficking Front

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source PDF** | `EFTA01657299.pdf` |
| **Dataset** | DS10 |
| **Pages** | 6 pages (p001–p006) |
| **Date** | June 10–11, 2010 |
| **Category** | `07-Communications/text-messages` |
| **Interest Score** | Not yet scored (outside 5K sample) |
| **Organized Location** | `_ORGANIZED/07-Communications/text-messages/DS10/` |

### Summary
FBI Child Exploitation Task Force internal email chain. An FBI agent interviews **Sergio Cordero** (modeling agent and business partner of Jean-Luc Brunel) and reports findings to FBI supervisors.

### Key Quotes (verbatim from document)

> "Cordero confirmed that Brunel uses MC2 as a legitimate transport agency of underage girls into America for purposes of sex."

> "Brunel uses MC2 to introduce underage girls to Epstein since Epstein gave him $1 million dollars to start up MC2 after he was fired from various modeling agencies in Paris"

> "Brunel has always been Epstein's principal supplier of underage girls using MC2 as a cover up"

> "Many of the underage girls that Brunel and Epstein shared and liked continue to live in Brunel's 1 bedroom apt in NY… There are some underage girls living there now." *(Written in 2010!)*

> "Cordero confirmed that former President Clinton was on Epstein's plane with Brunel several times with underage girls. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS HEAR SAY SINCE HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT HE WAS NOT THERE. Cordero stated that Brunel told him this information."

> "Epstein's HOUSE MANAGER ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ was ARRESTED FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE on 11/09 — for attempting to sell notebook (the golden nugget), to an undercover agent for $50K. That notebook contained and confirmed all allegations and had photos, emails and notes outlining Epstein and Brunel's sex trafficking scheme."

### Follow-up from FBI Supervisor (June 11, 2010, p003)
> "I talked to SSA [redacted] who is the supervisor for the crimes against children squad here. He advised that he would like to interview Sergio Cordero… He said that Mr. Cordero will be told upfront that after the initial interview by us, he will be put into a grand jury to testify about the information he is airing."

### Why This Matters
- FBI agents explicitly documenting MC2 as a sex trafficking front, not just a modeling agency
- Corroboration of Clinton on Epstein's plane (hearsay, noted as such by FBI agent)
- Confirms the "golden nugget" notebook was real and contained comprehensive evidence
- Written in 2010 — shows FBI had this information years before the 2019 SDNY indictment
- Grand jury testimony was being arranged for Cordero

## 2. Geoffrey Berman (SDNY) — "Private and Confidential"

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source PDF** | `EFTA00016124.pdf` |
| **Dataset** | DS9 / DS10 |
| **Category** | `03-Emails/general-correspondence` + `07-Communications/general-communications` |
| **Interest Score** | 81 (emails), 92 (communications) |
| **Sender** | `berman, geoffrey (usanys)` |
| **Subject** | "My bad - no fewer than 4 articles today. Still relatively slow" |

### Summary
Email from **Geoffrey Berman** (USANYS — US Attorney for SDNY) forwarding/discussing press coverage. Berman is the US Attorney who indicted Epstein in 2019. A journalist asks why **three successive DOJ administrations** (Bush, Obama, Trump) protected **Prince Andrew**, and why the DOJ granted immunity to procurers — explicitly naming **Ghislaine Maxwell**.

The communications version (EFTA00016124, score=92) references: epstein, trump, clinton, andrew with location/activity/financial/legal keywords.

### Why This Matters
- The prosecutor who brought the 2019 case was receiving pointed questions about systemic DOJ protection of Andrew
- Raises the question of why immunity was granted to Maxwell and other procurers in the original plea deal
- Three administrations spanning both parties implicated in protecting Andrew

### Action Items
- [ ] Read full content of EFTA00016124.pdf across all pages
- [ ] Cross-reference with DOJ plea deal documents in Legal-Filings category
- [ ] Check if Berman's response to the journalist exists in the files

## 3. Ghislaine Maxwell Draft PR Statements

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source PDF** | `EFTA01186642.pdf` (multiple pages) |
| **Dataset** | DS9 |
| **Category** | `03-Emails/epstein-maxwell` |
| **Interest Scores** | 36–84 across multiple pages |

### Summary
At least **two versions** of draft PR/media statements prepared by or for Ghislaine Maxwell, found across multiple pages of the same source document.

### Version 1 — Meeting Virginia at Mar-a-Lago
Maxwell's account of meeting Virginia Roberts:
- Claims she met Virginia at **Mar-a-Lago**
- *"she said she was a masseuse"*
- *"Prince Andrew came to my house to visit me — [Virginia] was in the house and they did meet"*
- Denies knowledge of any sexual activity involving Andrew, Dershowitz, or Clinton

### Version 2 — Attacking Virginia's Credibility
Different tone, attacks Virginia Roberts:
- Claims Virginia *"was working as a waitress in a burger bar when she left the country after being arrested for stealing 300 dollars in tips"*
- References attorneys **Rothstein** and **Edwards**
- Appears to be a more aggressive PR strategy

| p008 | 82 | *(none)* | epstein, maxwell, andrew |

### Why This Matters
- Multiple versions of PR statements show coordinated damage control
- Admission that Andrew and Virginia did meet at Maxwell's house
- Two different PR strategies visible — conciliatory vs. attack-the-victim
- References to "Vanity Fair" suggest coordination around specific media coverage

## 4. Epstein–Sitrick Crisis PR Coordination

| **Dataset** | DS9 |
| **Category** | `03-Emails/epstein-maxwell` |
| **Date** | March 9, 2011 |
| **Interest Score** | 84 |
| **Sender** | Jeffrey Epstein (`jeevacation@gmail.com`) |
| **Recipient** | Mike Sitrick |
| **Organized Location** | `_ORGANIZED/03-Emails/epstein-maxwell/DS9/` |

### Summary
**Mike Sitrick** (crisis PR specialist) emails Epstein about the Daily Mail article titled "GHISLAINE HAS FEMALES FOR MR SE". Sitrick is coordinating with Epstein's legal team including **Dershowitz, Weinberg, Knight, and Lefkowitz**.

Draft press statement prepared by the team:
> *"the government did not charge, nor were there ever allegations that Jeffrey Epstein was a pedophile."*

### Epstein's Defense (verbatim)
> "also the she has females was a message from the local massage parlor. not from ghislaine"

> "The fourteen year old told the police that she swore she was 18, and that mr epstein would not let anyone in the house who was not."

### Why This Matters
- Shows Epstein actively managing media narrative with a professional crisis PR firm
- The draft statement's careful wording — technically the plea deal was for solicitation, not pedophilia
- Epstein's personal defense: blaming a "massage parlor" for the "she has females" message, claiming the 14-year-old lied about her age
- Full legal team coordination visible: Dershowitz, Weinberg, Knight, Lefkowitz all involved

## 5. Epstein as "Team Leader" — Legal Strategy Email

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source PDF** | *(Need to locate exact ID)* |
| **Category** | Emails |
| **Date** | *(circa 2010–2011)* |

### Summary
Epstein emails his full legal team — **Lefkowitz, Weinberg, Roy Black, Dershowitz, Indyke** — cc'ing **Sitrick** (PR) and **Goldberger**:

> *"Roy has the best feel. He is team leader. He has the respect of the local judges prosecutors etc. He gets to decide."*

Mentions **"South Florida, Marie, Acosta, Ferrar"** — key actors in the plea deal.

### Why This Matters
- Epstein directly managing his own legal strategy, choosing Roy Black as point person
- Name-drops **Acosta** (the US Attorney who gave the sweetheart plea deal, later Trump's Labor Secretary)
- "Marie" likely refers to Assistant US Attorney Marie Villafaña who handled the case
- Shows Epstein's confidence in his legal team's relationships with local judiciary

## 6. Epstein → Michael Wolff "nfw"

| **Category** | `03-Emails/dershowitz-related` |
| **Date** | March 31, 2015 |
| **Interest Score** | 87 |
| **Sender** | Jeffrey E. (`jeevacation@gmail.com`) |
| **Recipient** | Michael Wolff |
| **Subject** | Fwd: fact checking questions for New York Magazine story |

### Summary
**Alex Yablon** from New York Magazine sends detailed fact-checking questions to Epstein for an upcoming story. Epstein forwards the entire email to **Michael Wolff** (journalist/author, later wrote "Fire and Fury" about Trump) with a single word: **"nfw"** (no fucking way).

### Key Fact-Checking Questions Asked
- *"do you advise the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on how to convince other billionaires to join their initiatives?"*
- *"did you volunteer to invest $20 million dollars in Michael's attempt to buy New York Magazine in 2004?"*
- *"do you believe the recent claims about Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew in relation to you are 'ludicrous'?"*
- *"Do you have a support staff of young women in their 20s and 30s?"*
- *"Did you date Eva Andersson Dubin? Have you known her for 30 years? Did you pay for her to go to medical school?"*
- Questions about properties in New Mexico, Paris, Palm Beach, the Caribbean
- Questions about a "current girlfriend" who is a "dental student"

### Why This Matters
- Epstein's relationship with Michael Wolff — close enough to forward sensitive media inquiries
- The Gates Foundation question confirms journalists were investigating the Epstein–Gates connection as early as 2015
- "nfw" response suggests Epstein and Wolff had a shared understanding about media strategy
- Eva Andersson Dubin connection (wife of Glenn Dubin, hedge fund manager)
- Multiple email addresses visible: `jeevacation@gmail.com`, `leevacation@gmail.com` (OCR variants)

| **Date** | Jan 28-30, 2011 (dinner invite), Jan 29, 2010 (Pritzker intro), Feb 7, 2011 ("blind carbons" email) |
| **Category** | `07-Communications/text-messages`, `03-Emails` |

### Summary

**Document 1 — Dinner with "Bill" (EFTA01801573, DS10)**
Boris Nikolic texts Epstein (Jan 30, 2011):
> *"Just landed to Iga. Are you in? Is it 7:30pm tmr ok? I will come w bill at that time."*

Epstein had replied (Jan 28, 2011):
> *"I can find out if mick jagger, ken starr, clinton . julie taymor , are in town!? I suggest we leave it till mon night.. I will have no trouble getting anyone you want . but i think it best after the three of us noodle a bit."*

**Document 2 — "bill gates right hand" (EFTA02430778, DS11)**
Epstein introduces Nikolic to **Tom Pritzker** (billionaire Hyatt Hotels heir, Jan 29, 2010):
> *"boris nikolic is bill gates right hand, he is a good friend."*

**Document 3 — "Blind Carbons" to Nikolic (EFTA01835579, DS10)**
Epstein to Nikolic (Feb 7, 2011):
> *"I always make Blind carbons to you.. so it stays between you and I"*
> *"bill: OK! and sorry sorry sorry...he wants to know though. and you are both in the same boat as far as being expert vs. amateur on a range of issues. but you are both fenders and shapers in many spaces where you both share only amateur ability! from where i sit (special initiatives) there are things you both might enjoy doing together."*

### Why This Matters
- Direct evidence of the Epstein–Gates connection through Nikolic
- Epstein positioning himself as social gatekeeper who can summon celebrities and politicians
- **Ken Starr** — the special prosecutor who investigated Bill Clinton, later defended Epstein
- Nikolic was later named as backup executor in Epstein's will (August 2019, days before death)
- Links Gates' inner circle directly to Epstein's social network
- **"Blind carbons" email** — Epstein secretly copying Nikolic on communications with Bill Gates, indicating a covert coordination channel
- Epstein describing himself as running "special initiatives" and positioning himself as bridge between Gates and Nikolic
- **Tom Pritzker** connection — Epstein introducing Gates' advisor to one of America's wealthiest families
- Full-scan contact network confirms: **Nikolic sent 1,614 messages** and **received 1,300 messages** — making him one of the most frequent communicators in the entire corpus
- **Kathy Ruemmler** similarly frequent: **984 messages sent, 788 received**

| **Dataset** | DS11 |
| **Date** | May 4, 2016, 1:29 AM |
| **Category** | `07-Communications/text-messages` |

### Summary
Text message from **"Shanson900"** to Epstein:

> *"Trumps going to win in November. When are u in NYC"*

### Why This Matters
- Places Epstein in active political conversations during the 2016 election
- Shows someone in Epstein's circle was confident of Trump's victory 6 months before the election
- Identity of "Shanson900" unknown — could be significant
- Paired with Finding #9 (Jane Doe v. Trump), shows Epstein tracking Trump-related legal matters

### Action Items
- [ ] Identify "Shanson900" — check phone records, contact lists
- [ ] Look for other 2016 election-related communications

## 9. Jane Doe v. Trump — "told you"

| **Dataset** | DS11 |
| **Date** | November 4, 2016, 10:18 PM and 10:24 PM |
| **Category** | `07-Communications/text-messages` |

### Summary
Two emails sent by Epstein within 6 minutes of each other on the evening of November 4, 2016 — **4 days before the presidential election**.

**Email 1 (EFTA02447591, 10:18 PM) — To Kathy Ruemmler:**
> From: Jeffrey E. `<jeevacation@gmail.com>`
> To: Kathy Ruemmler
> Subject: **told you**

Epstein forwards the automated PACER notification of Jane Doe's voluntary dismissal (Case 1:16-cv-07673-RA, Doe v. Trump et al).

**Email 2 (EFTA02447641, 10:24 PM) — To unknown recipient:**
> From: Jeffrey E. `<jeevacation@gmail.com>`
> Subject: **told you, the case ws a fake**

Same PACER notification forwarded, with Epstein adding: **"the case ws a fake"**

### Why This Matters
- Epstein was actively tracking the Jane Doe v. Trump case
- **TWO separate emails** — one to Ruemmler, another to someone else — show Epstein broadcasting the dismissal
- "told you" implies Epstein had previously predicted or discussed the case's outcome with Ruemmler
- **"the case ws a fake"** — Epstein's own characterization of the Jane Doe allegations against Trump
- **Kathy Ruemmler** is a significant figure: Obama White House Counsel, later met with Epstein multiple times (reported by NYT)
- The timing — **4 days before the 2016 presidential election** — is politically explosive
- The case alleged Trump and Epstein sexually assaulted a 13-year-old; it was voluntarily dismissed, plaintiff claimed threats
- Combined with Finding #8 ("Trump's going to win"), shows Epstein was deeply engaged with the 2016 election

### Action Items

- [ ] Search for other Ruemmler correspondence in the files
- [ ] Check if there are earlier emails where Epstein discusses this case ("told you" implies prior conversation)

| **Date** | March 8–9, 2011 |
| **Interest Score** | 84 |

### Summary
The Daily Mail article text is embedded in the email chain (Finding #4). It reports on telephone message logs from Epstein's "Florida child sex den":

From the article:
> *"Ghislaine Maxwell… is apparently implicated in the procurement of masseuses. She once called to say: 'She has females for Mr JE.'"*

> *"a message from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just did a good one — 18 years. (She spoke to me and said, "I love Jeffrey")'."*

> *"One message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.' It was left in February 2005"*

> *"The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends including the business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein, magician David Copperfield"*

### Epstein's Defense
See Finding #4. Claims the "she has females" message was from a "local massage parlor, not from Ghislaine."

### Summary
Text from **Shanson900** (Steve Hanson — see email headers) to Epstein:
> *"30 min for the girls. 292 gerard drive. East hampton"*

Epstein forwards to **Steve Hanso[n]** and writes:
> *"Steve I will lock everything up well, key under pot?"*

### Why This Matters
- **"30 min for the girls"** at a specific East Hampton address is deeply suggestive
- Same sender "Shanson900" as Finding #8 ("Trump's going to win")
- Identity now partially resolved: **Steve Hanson** — appears to be a close associate with access to Epstein's properties
- Pattern of Epstein using East Hampton properties (292 Gerard Drive) for meetings involving "girls"
- The casual tone and key-under-pot arrangement suggests routine activity

| **Datasets** | Primarily DS9, DS10, DS11 |
| **Categories** | `03-Emails/scheduling-travel`, `03-Emails/personal`, `07-Communications/text-messages` |
| **Focus** | Day-to-day mechanics: pickups, model routing, visas, apartment operations, air/ground fallback, wire-funded travel, passport scheduling |

### Summary
Targeted follow-up reads for Investigation B surfaced a coherent operations chain across multiple years: transport coordination, model-routing instructions, visa support language, apartment servicing/move-out logistics tied to MC2/Brunel, and urgent payment execution for flights and ground transfer.

### Key Quotes (verbatim from documents)

From `EFTA00425993` (DS9):
> "You are to take her to next modeling agency. Please confirm these changes!"

> "check in with me before picking up Daniella... [she] is not supposed to go to NExt Modeling Agency from the airport..."

From `EFTA00748155` (DS9):
> "I have some girls in mind for your job, but none has a visa..."

> "do you want to do it? otherwise i can help with their visas"

From `EFTA02505598` / `EFTA01746635` (DS11/DS10):
> "jean luc brunet appt access"

> "Please let me know, if we can send the maid."

> "blank move-out form for 301 e 66th st, nyc 10065 ... scheduled for Monday the 13th of april"

From `EFTA00347549` / `EFTA00459584` (DS9):
> "Need JE car upon arrival., No helicopter today,. Since (Heli is in Fort Lauderdale for annual inspection.,)"

> "No helicopter today. JE will have to be picked up by vehicle"

From `EFTA00407158` / `EFTA01179636` (DS9):
> "Payment of services for Aug. 4- need wired asap"

> "we still haven't seen any payment for the plane ... and the ground transportation"

From `EFTA00492020` (DS9):
> "You have an appointment tomorrow ... at the Passport Agency in West Palm..."

> "Should I change Jeffrey's flight to Tues. March 12?"

### Why This Matters
- Moves beyond high-level allegations to repeated, concrete operational instructions.
- Links scheduling staff, travel handlers, and finance coordination in the same workflow.
- Shows documented fallback behavior (helicopter unavailable -> vehicle pickup) and rapid payment execution for transport.
- Adds process-level evidence not previously captured in the original 15 findings.
