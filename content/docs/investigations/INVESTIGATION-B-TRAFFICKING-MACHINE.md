were recruited, transported, housed, and abused. It examines the enabling

made the operation function. It focuses on the MECHANICS of the operation 
rather than the powerful clients (covered in Investigation A).

## MANUAL ENHANCEMENT ADDENDUM (POST-RUN DEEP READ)

The automated pass surfaced broad patterns. A targeted read of specific source files adds cleaner operational evidence.

### 1) Airport Pickup -> Model Agency Routing

- **Source:** `_ORGANIZED/03-Emails/scheduling-travel/DS9/email-screenshot__EFTA00425993_20260202_p001_i001.md`
- **Date in document:** October 14, 2011
- **Quoted operational language:**
  - "Jojo! Danielle now arrives ... at JFK at 1:25 pm ... You are to take her to next modeling agency. Please confirm these changes!"
  - "check in with me before picking up Daniella... [she] is not supposed to go to NExt Modeling Agency from the airport..."
- **Why it matters:** direct logistics instruction linking airport pickup and model-agency routing.

### 2) Visa Assistance + "Girls ... for your job" Language

- **Source:** `_ORGANIZED/03-Emails/personal/DS9/email-screenshot+deposition-transcript__EFTA00748155_20260203_p001_i001.md`
- **Date in document:** April 2010
- **Quoted operational language:**
  - "I have some girls in mind for your job, but none has a visa..."
  - "do you want to do it? otherwise i can help with their visas"
  - "otherwise you can orgainze a casting on behalf of mc2.."
- **Why it matters:** document text links recruitment language to visa facilitation and MC2-related casting workflow.

### 3) MC2 / Brunel Apartment Servicing and Move-Out Coordination

- **Sources:**
  - `_ORGANIZED/07-Communications/text-messages/DS11/email-screenshot+deposition-transcript__EFTA02505598_20260210_p001_i001.md`
  - `_ORGANIZED/07-Communications/text-messages/DS10/email-screenshot+deposition-transcript__EFTA01746635_20260130_p001_i001.md`
- **Date in documents:** April 7, 2015
- **Quoted operational language:**
  - "jean luc brunet appt access"
  - "the maid has been refused to access the apartment ... Please let me know, if we can send the maid."
  - "blank move-out form for 301 e 66th st, nyc 10065 ... scheduled for Monday the 13th of april"
- **Why it matters:** records a concrete MC2-related apartment operations chain (staff access, movers, scheduling, address-level logistics).

### 4) Real-Time Transport Substitution (Heli Down -> Car Pickup)

- **Sources:**
  - `_ORGANIZED/03-Emails/legal-correspondence/DS9/email-screenshot+deposition-transcript+court-document+legal-filing__EFTA00347549_20260202_p001_i001.md`
  - `_ORGANIZED/03-Emails/general-correspondence/DS9/email-screenshot+deposition-transcript__EFTA00459584_20260202_p001_i001.md`
- **Dates in documents:** May 26, 2015 and July 16, 2017
- **Quoted operational language:**
  - "Need JE car upon arrival. No helicopter today ... (Heli is in Fort Lauderdale for annual inspection.)"
  - "No helicopter today. JE will have to be picked up by vehicle"
- **Why it matters:** shows day-of movement control and fallback planning when aircraft assets were unavailable.

### 5) Time-Sensitive Wire Transfers for Travel Services

- **Sources:**
  - `_ORGANIZED/03-Emails/scheduling-travel/DS9/email-screenshot+deposition-transcript+legal-filing+court-document__EFTA00407158_20260202_p001_i001.md`
  - `_ORGANIZED/03-Emails/personal/DS9/email-screenshot+deposition-transcript+court-document__EFTA01179636_20260203_p001_i001.md`
- **Date in documents:** August 2, 2012
- **Quoted operational language:**
  - "Payment of services for Aug. 4- need wired asap"
  - "if we wire funds in euros ... it takes two business days ... or we can pay in US $ ... same day"
  - "we still haven't seen any payment for the plane ... and the ground transportation"
- **Why it matters:** documents urgency and method for funding transport operations (air + ground).

### 6) Passport / Travel Document Scheduling

- **Source:** `_ORGANIZED/03-Emails/scheduling-travel/DS9/email-screenshot+deposition-transcript+legal-filing__EFTA00492020_20260202_p001_i001.md`
- **Date in document:** March 2019
- **Quoted operational language:**
  - "You have an appointment tomorrow ... at the Passport Agency in West Palm..."
  - "Should I change Jeffrey's flight to Tues. March 12?"
- **Why it matters:** demonstrates direct staff handling of travel-document workflow tied to flight planning.

### Targeted Keyword Sweep (Post-Run Validation)

The same operational phrases appear across multiple organized files:

- `next modeling agency` -> `EFTA00425993`
- `some girls in mind for your job` / `help with their visas` -> repeated across `EFTA00748155`, `EFTA00748171`, `EFTA00748175`, `EFTA00748180`, `EFTA00761391`, `EFTA00761396`
- `Need JE car upon arrival` / `No helicopter today` -> `EFTA00347549`, `EFTA00459584`
- `Payment of services for Aug. 4- need wired asap` -> `EFTA00407158`, `EFTA01179636`, `EFTA02558219`
