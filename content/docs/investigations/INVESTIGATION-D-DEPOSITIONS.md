show that Clinton frequently flew with Epstein aboard his plane, then suddenly stopped - raising the

Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him, including those for his assistant (Doug Band), his 
schedulers, and what appear to be Clinton's personal numbers. This information certainly leads one to

The FOIA media team advised they downloaded media from file number 31E-MM-108062, including audio and video. However, there seem to be some technical issues, 
as they are unable to listen to 48 audios located in the 1A Vol 3. Per our Document Conversion Unit, this is a "codec problem," meaning there was probably some sort of 
user error from The AUSA's office when they exported the media to the disc. This issue cannot be resolved on

18. 
While research by other plaintiffs' attorneys and myself has uncovered other persons 
that were acquaintances of Mr. Epstein, specifically Donald Trump, Alan Dershowitz, Bill Clinton, 
Tommy Mottola, and David Copperfield, we have no information that any of those people (other than 
Mr. Dershowitz) have spoken to Mr. Epstein about Jane Doe or any of the other specific victims of Mr. 
Epstein's molestation. Mr. Dershowitz is acting as an attorney for Mr. Epstein, and therefore it is 
presumably unlikely to question him about any admissions that Epstein may have made regarding Jane 
Doe or other minors girls. Additionally, we have no information that any of those individuals or any 
other individuals have any taped statements of Epstein's own voice relating to these matters. George 
Rush's taped conversation with Mr. Epstein is the only known one in existence, making it very unique 
and it contains information not otherwise obtainable through other means or sources. Indeed, without 
the Rush tape conversation, the jury that handles the case will not hear any words from Epstein himself 
about his abuse of Jane Doe and other young girls. I have been informed by Epstein's attorney that 
Epstein intends to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights rather than answer any substantive questions 
about the abuse of Jane Doe and other girls at trial.

The Rush interview is, in any event, unique and not otherwise obtainable from other 
witnesses because it can be used to prove perjury

The Show Cause Order 
On April 19, 2018, the Court entered its Order to Show Cause Why Fowler White and

did not, and does not, reside in Palm Beach County. A true and correct copy of the Subpoena 
Duces Tecurn is again attached hereto as "Exhibit A." Additionally, knowing of Epstein's actual, 
legal residency in the United States Virgin Islands, Edwards's counsel selectively withheld this 
information from this Court when it cited the deposition of Jeffrey Epstein taken on January 25, 
2012 as his sole basis to improperly argue that Epstein resided in Palm Beach County, Florida. In 
fact, in the very deposition upon which Edwards's counsel relied in argument at hearing, which 
was taken by the same counsel for Edwards in the case of Epstein v. Edwards, Epstein testified as 
follows: "my residence address is 6100 Hook Boulevard in the Virgin Islands." Counsel then 
asked: "do you maintain any other residences presently?" and Epstein replied "I have vacation 
homes in New Mexico, Palm Beach, New York, and Paris." See partial deposition transcript of 
Jeffrey Epstein dated January 25, 2012, p. 5; lines 6-14, attached hereto as "Exhibit B" (emphasis 
added). Epstein's vacation home in Palm Beach no more confers residency on him than do any of 
the other vacation homes he owns. 
Further, Epstein's Virgin Islands residency is established by Epstein's tax form 1040, 
which was provided to Edwards in response to discovery requests in the Edwards v. Epstein matter. 
The form 1040 provided to Edwards and his counsel in that matter, the same counsel representing 
Edwards in the instant ca

Deposition taken before Jeana Ricciuti, Registered

State of Florida at Large, in the above cause. 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're on the video record. 
This is the 8th day of October, 2009, and the time 
it approximately 10:07 a.m. 
This is the continuation of the videotaped 
deposition of Jeffrey Epstein in the matter of 
versus Epstein. This deposition is being held at 
250 South Australian Avenue, No. 1400 in West Palm

expect there to necessarily be. 
MR. LINK: Your Honor, why would I be 
standing here? 
THE COURT: I am going to give you that 
first, and tell you what my initial 
inclination is as if we were sitting here 
and these questions were being asked at 
trial. It would be a whole lot shorter 
because all I would have to say is sustained 
or overruled, but I don't have that luxury 
right now. 
MR. LINK: You are struck with us right 
now. 
THE COURT: We will go through this. 
We will start at page eight, lines 11 
through 19 -- this is the March 17, 2010 
deposition of Jeffrey Epstein. 
Mr. Scarola, the first one -- the first 
two questions, my inclination is to permit 
those questions to be asked, finding, 
consistent with Frazier and its progeny, 
that such information will be able to be 
proffered or testified to outside of the 
mere invocation of the Fifth Amendment 
privilege by Mr. Epstein as to questions

team prefer the inflammatory appellation of "billionaire pedophile" to any other. 
Edwards continues to troll for clients interested in bringing civil damage suits against 
Epstein who are in need of legal representation. 
Edwards has established a pattern of using high profile personalities and/or 
celebrities who are alleged Epstein acquaintances by implicating their knowledge of 
and/or participation in the alleged activities for which Edwards seeks to hold Epstein 
civilly liable.4 To that end, Edwards has noticed for deposition many of these public 
personalities and celebrities. Such conduct becomes tabloid fodder when counsel then 
engages in extra-judicial interviews with the press. For example, on March 13, 2011, the 
British publication "The Observer" reported that "Prince Andrew could be pulled into the 
mess as a witness. Edwards's [sic] lawyer, Jack Scarola, said last week that his team 
intended to try and get a statement from the prince about what he may or may not have 
seen while attending parties with Epstein." See Exhibit B, attached hereto. The news 
story continued: 
Though the prince is likely to claim diplomatic immunity, that step will 
not keep his name out of the court papers or the headlines.... The same 
thing goes for previous cases involving Epstein. They amount to a 
potential source of PR torture for the royal family as media scrutiny 
continues. 
In closing, the article states that "there is no evidence or suggestion that Andrew was 
involved"

implicated Dershowitz by invoking their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination26
when asked questions about Dershowitz's connection to Epstein's abuse — including a specific 
question about whether Dershowitz had been involved with massages by young girls. Sarah 
Kellen took the Fifth when asked: 
Have you seen a gentleman by the name of Alan Dershowitz at the home of 
Jeffrey Epstein before? 
Do you know Alan Dershowitz? 
Are you aware of friendship between [Alan] Dershowitz and Jeffrey Epstein? 
When [Alan] Dershowitz comes to Palm Beach, he stays at the El Brillo mansion, 
doesn't he? 
[H]as [Alan] Dershowitz ever been there when young ladies came to give 
massages? 
Has [Alan] Dershowitz ever been the beneficiary of those massages [given by 
young ladies at Epstein's mansionfri

Doe No. 21 Epstein, No. 8:09-cv-801 19-KAM (Mar. 24, 2010) (emphasis added) (excerpts 
attached as Exhibit 21). Nadia Marcinkova pled the Fifth when asked: 
Do you know what Jeffrey Epstein's relationship is with Alan Dershowitz? 
That's somebody [i.e., Dershowitz] who you know to have stayed at Jeffery 
Epstein's house on many occasions, correct? 
And also somebody who you know to have been at the house when E.W. was in 
Jeffrey Epstein's bedroom getting sexually abused, correct?

would have credited this vague testimony about an unnamed individual over the evidence 
presented at trial, including the testimony of Juan Alessi and an email chain between the 
Defendant and Markham that indicates that the Defendant worked closely with Markham to 
create the manual and provided specific content, such as the checklists, to be included. See GX-
424. 
Finally, the Defendant refers to her prior briefing in which she alleged substantial 
prejudice because of the absence of other deceased potential witnesses, including Epstein, 
Epstein's mother,- talent agent Michael Casey, and Palm Beach Police Department 
Detective Joseph Recarey. See Dkt. No. 138 at 8-11. The Court has previously considered and 
rejected the Defendant's claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F. 
Supp. 3d at 317. The Defendant points to no development at trial that she believes should alter 
the Court's conclusion, nor is the Court aware of any such reason for reconsideration. 
The Defendant's reply brief devotes just a single sentence to her claim of pre-indictment 
delay and does not address any of the defects identified by the Government. She has not 
satisfied either element required for a claim of pre-indictment delay, as she has not demonstrated 
that the Government improperly delayed prosecution nor that she suffered actual and substantial 
prejudice from such delay. The Court therefore denies he

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 357 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/16/2009 Page 2 of 8 
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
post a $15 million bond to secure any potential judgment in this case (DE 165 in case 
no. 9:08-CV-80119). The motion alleged that Epstein was hiding hundreds of millions of 
dollars in assets in an effort to defeat any judgment that Jane Doe (and many other 
victims of his child sexual abuse) might obtain against him. On July 13, 2009, Epstein 
filed his response. 
Without specifically denying any of Jane Doe's allegations of 
fraudulent transfers, Epstein essentially argued that Jane Doe lacked any proof of such 
transfers [DE 198]. 
Jane Doe filed a reply to Epstein's response on July 23, 2009 [DE 217]. But, in 
addition to the information and arguments provided there, Jane Doe now wants to alert 
the Court to newly-discovered evidence bolstering her arguments regarding Epstein's 
fraudulent concealment of his assets. Yesterday (October 15, 2009) counsel for Jane 
Doe took the deposition of Larry Visoski, who has been Jeffrey Epstein's personal pilot 
for approximately 18 years, flying (for example) Epstein's Boeing 727 jet. Visoski 
declared that, in the last year, Epstein has transferred to him four very valuable cars 
and a boat and registered them in his (Visoski's) name. A transcript of the deposition 
will not be available until October 22, 2009. But in view of the extreme relevance of this 
information to Jane Doe's pending-motion, she wanted to adv

Plaintiff, Jane Doe. No. 3, served answers to interrogatories wherein she lists certain 
witness that may have knowledge regarding the facts and allegations alleged in her complaint 
including, but not limited to, Jane Doe No. 2. See Exhibit "A", Answer to Interrogatories, No. 
5, in redacted form. An unredacted copy of the responses will be provided to the court upon the 
court's request and/or in camera. In particular, the response to interrogatory number 5 states that 
Jane Doe numbers 2 and 3 accompanied each other to Defendant's estate. Plaintiff admits this 
much in her Motion. Defendant seeks to take the deposition of Jane Doe. No. 3 as a witness in 
the instant matter and as a party in Plaintiff her own case, which she is an unidentified Plaintiff 
traveling under Jane Doe. No. 3. 
In an attempt to resolve this matter by letter correspondence, Defendant agreed and 
offered only to take the deposition of Jane Doe. No. 3 as a witness in all Jane Doe 2-7 cases only 
one time and separately one time as a Party Plaintiff in the matter Jane Doe No. 3 filed against 
Jeffrey Epstein. While this is a reasonable compromise in that Defendant has agreed not to take 
her deposition three (3) times as Plaintiff suspected, Plaintiff's counsel refused to agree. Plaintiff 
cannot file a lawsuit and then expect this court to protect her from being deposed as a party for 
the time period proscri

witness in the instant matter or any matter they have knowledge of as reflected in the 
interrogatory responses. 
Therefore, Defendant has a right to depose each party-plaintiff 
separately and then as a witness at least once. Deposing Jane Doc No. 3 as a witness in the 
instant matter is necessary as that deposition will be tailored toward facts known by Jane Doe. 
No. 3 as those facts pertain to Jane Doe. No. 2's claims in her complaint as opposed to the facts 
alleged by Jane Doe. No. 3 in her individual action. 
Plaintiff's attorneys claim that sitting for more than one deposition will be traumatizing 
does not modify the rules and/or the law with regard to the right to take party and witness 
depositions. Plaintiff offers no expert medical or psychological support, by an affidavit of an 
expert or the Plaintiff herself, to support her position. In almost all instances, none of the 
Plaintiff's sought or received any psychological counseling until the concept of a lawsuit and 
money was introduced. 
A party may, by oral questions take the deposition of any person, 
without leave of court. Rule 30, Fed.R. Civ.,P. Conducting these depositions separately will 
allow for the proper preparation as to each deponent's knowledge as that knowledge pertains to 
the specific case at hand (i.e., whether the deponent is a witness and/or a party plaintiff). Again, 
Defendant is willing to condu

The shocking testimony of Jane Doe versus Jeffrey Epstein 
The first surprise for her attorney was when Jane doe said she'd prefer that Epstein 
be in the room during her testimony. She said she was unaware that her attorney 
filed an action to keep him out due to her fear of intimidation. The next few hours 
were filled with the attorney affirmatively violating the courts order, telling his 
client not to answer questions re her sexual history. Though the judge had already 
ruled. Told his client , not to give the name of her sister, falsely asserting a right to 
privacy. -odd that he just finished the useless deposition of Epsteins brother, with 
the full knowledge that he had no knowledge of the case. 
1. Hardly the innocent victim she claimed to be. After a methodical questioning by 
mark lutier, gentle respectful but surgical. The Jane Dow admitted that virtually her 
entire statement under oath to the FBI was a lie. We can now see why she didn't 
want her name used, on her first of what will be many days of sworn testimony, she 
swore that her attorney had filled in her answers incorrectly and then had to plead 
the fifth on at least 40 occasions when the questions regarding the truthfulness of 
her statements became apparent. First . It seems she wasn't exactly broke as she 
alleged, or as she began her tale of woe she claimed she was working for the 
minimum wage of 750 per hour. She shocked everyone in the room when she 
admitted to being an escort call girl, sex wor

actions in their pretrial stage, under many circumstances, will be a desirable administrative 
technique and is within the power of the Court." Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure 
§2382 (2008). See also 
Eagle Building Technologies 209 F.R.C. 499, 501 (S.D. Fla. 
2002) (noting that Court has broad discretion under Rule 42(a) to consolidate cases within its 
district). "In deciding whether to consolidate actions, we have instructed that district courts should 
consider whether doing so could lead to prejudice or confusion." Ramsay'. Broward County 
Sheriff's Office, 2008 WL 5237162 *3 (11th Cir. 2008). 
The common and overlapping issues in this case, both factual and legal, are patent and 
obvious. Here, Plaintiff moves for limited consolidation, for purposes of pretrial discovery only. 
Such a consolidation is common and appropriate to further the interests of judicial economy and 
efficiency. See, e.g., In re Enron Corp. Securities Litigation, 206 F.R.P. 427, 438 (S.D. Tex. 2002). 
At the same time, there is no conceivable prejudice or confusion that would result from 
consolidation for purposes of pretrial discovery. To the contrary, consolidation will avoid 
unnecessary prejudice and confusion. For example, with regard to the instant Motion, consolidation 
for purposes of discovery would make it clear that each party/witness can only be deposed once, 
covering all issues in the

should have known the allegations were false or would have known they were false if they had 
done even minimal investigation into Jane Doe No. 3's story. 
Edwards and Cassell then filed this action, alleging that Dershowitz committed the tort of 
defamation in making these statements to the media. To prevail on their defamation claim and 
defeat Dershowitz's affirmative defenses, Edwards and Cassell must substantiate their allegation 
that Dershowitz made the statements to the media even though he "knew [the filing containing 
Jane Doe No. 3's outrageous allegations was] an entirely proper and well-founded pleading." In 
other words, they must prove both that the allegations were "well-founded" and that Dershowitz 
knew they were true. See Exhibit A, Compl.  17. The testimony of Jane Doe No. 3 and the 
documents requested in the subpoena are at the very heart of this issue, which Edwards and 
Cassell have placed squarely in dispute. There simply is no basis for crediting Jane Doe's 
assertions of "irrelevance." 
Jane Doe No. 3's alternative argument — that she should be shielded from any discovery 
in this action because Dershowitz is "abusing" the subpoena power by seeking information that 
is "highly personal" and "confidential" — is likewise unavailing. As an adult, Jane Doe No. 3 
has voluntarily submitted multiple sworn declarations and has given numerous media interviews 
in which she has detailed, at length, the very same events that she is now contending are "highly

magistrates except they shall not be required to make oath or give bond unless specifically 
required by the order appointing them." The undersigned has conferred with counsel for Jane 
Doe No. 3 and counsel for Plaintiffs, who consent to the appointment of a Special Magistrate for 
the limited purpose of presiding over the deposition of Jane Doe No. 3 and ruling on any 
objections that may arise during the course of that deposition. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court should deny the Motion to Quash because (1) the documents and testimony 
that Dershowitz seeks are relevant to this litigation; and (2) Dershowitz's need for this 
information clearly outweighs Jane Doe No. 3's privacy interests. The Court also should deny 
Jane Doe No. 3's request for a protective order because the proposed modifications to the 
subpoena are not reasonable. The Court should also enter a reference pursuant to Rule 1.490 that 
appoints a Special Magistrate to preside over the deposition of Jane Doe No. 3.

24, 2008 making similar allegations. Jack A. Goldberger, Esq., Mr. Epstein's attorney, attended a 
press conference in January, 2008 on Mr. Epstein's behalf, which concerned the filing of the first 
civil case. 
4. 
In March, 2008, I advised Mr. Goldberger in writing that I represent the woman who 
is Jane Doe No. 2. A redacted copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit "A". Mr. Goldberger 
is attorney of record for Mr. Epstein in a criminal case pending against Mr. Epstein in Palm Beach 
County. I subsequently wrote to Mr. Goldberger again and asked for his consent to conducting a 
single deposition of Jane Doe No. 2 to be used in both criminal and civil matters. A redacted copy of 
this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit "B". Mr. Goldberger was also asked if he would accept 
service on behalf of Mr. Epstein, but he failed to respond. 
5. 
Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff's process server made numerous attempts to serve Mr. 
Epstein with the Summons and Complaint at his New York residence, without success. It is my 
understanding that Defendant Epstein's principal residence is an approximate 45,000 square foot 
luxury townhouse in Manhattan. He also has an estate home in Palm Beach, an island in St. Thomas 
and a residence in New Mexico. I was later provided with information that Mr. Epstein was out of 
the country in and about April, 2008, in the State of Israel. I was further advise

Motions of both Jane Doe and Jane Doe No. 4 in their entirety.4 The decretal portion of this 
Omnibus Order, which Jane Doe No. 4 appeals, is as follows: 
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff Jane Doe's Motion 
for Protective Order Barring Second Deposition and for Sanctions. 
(D.E. #378); and Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 4's Motion for Protective 
re Second Day of Deposition (D.E. # 392) are DENIED. Epstein's 
counsel is hereby given leave to re-depose Jane Doe for up to 3 
additional hours and hereby given leave to re-depose Jane Doe 4 
for up to 4 additional hours. 
III. 
Abusive Deposition Questioning 
The transcripts of Jane Doe No. 4's deposition, attached hereto as Exhibits 1-3, are 
replete with instances of abusive deposition conduct, consisting of harassing, humiliating and 
irrelevant questions having no legitimate discovery purpose. This abusive and unnecessary 
questioning demonstrates that: (1) the deposition of Jane Doe No. 4, as well as the other 
Plaintiffs in these cases, can be fairly completed within 7 hours; and (2) providing Defendant 
with an additional four hours of deposition time for Jane Doe No. 4 will more likely than not 
subject Jane Doe No. 4 to additional abuse. 
For example, Defendant's counsel asked Jane Doe the following sequence of questions in 
response to her testimony that she has had three abortions: 
Q. — you went and aborted three kids? Why wouldn't you want

requested a date for the deposition of lane Doe No. 4. The deposition of Jane Doe No. 4 was to 
begin at 1:00 p.m, based on her schedule, and was moved from the undersigned's office to the 
office of the court reporter at her counsel's request. 
Pursuant to Rule 30(dX2) and (3)(A) and (C) and its reference to 37(aX5)), Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure, the court may impose an appropriate sanction, including reasonable expenses 
in attorneys fees incurred by any party on a person who impedes or delays the fair examination 
of the deponent. In this instance, the brief visual encounter, which was completely unintended 
and inadvertent, should not have been grounds for Plaintiff's counsel and Plaintiff refusing to 
move forward with the deposition. Furthermore, pursuant to (3)(A) and (C), Plaintiff and 
Plaintiff's counsel had no right to unilaterally terminate cancel the deposition and fail to move 
forward. Plaintiff should have continued with the deposition and filed any motion deemed 
appropriate post deposition. Therefore, Defendant is asking for the costs associated with the 
attendance of the court reporter, her transcript and the presence of the videographer. Defendant 
would also request reasonable fees for 2.5 hours at $500 per hour for being required to prepare 
this motion and affidavits associated with same. 
The records obtained thus far on Jane Doe No. 4, do not reflect any "emot

for deposition at the court ordered date and time. Jane Doe's deposition proceeded from 11:11 
a.m. until 6:05 p.m. The deposition transcript is in three volumes and at this point 446 pages in 
length. A complete copy of the deposition transcripts, volumes I-III, is attached hereto as 
Exhibits 1-3, respectively. 
Subsequent to the deposition, the parties attempted to reach agreement on the remaining 
time for a second day of deposition of Jane Doe No. 4. Plaintiff's counsel calculated the 
aggregate time of Jane Doe No. 4 in deposition on October 27, 2009 (excluding breaks) as 5 
hours, 35 minutes, which Defendant's counsel did not dispute. Defendant's counsel, however, 
insisted on taking Jane Doe No. 4's deposition for an additional 4 hours, giving Defendant 
almost 10 hours of aggregate deposition time of Jane Doe No. 4 over two days. As a result, 
Plaintiff filed a Motion for Protective Order on November 3, 2009 (DE 392). Prior to the filing 
of this Motion, another Plaintiff in these cases represented by different counsel, Jane Doe, filed a 
similar Motion for Protective Order (DE 378), attempting to limit Defendant from taking a 
second day of Jane Doe's deposition. The principal argument set forth in both Motions 
concerned interpretation of the Court's Order Consolidating Cases dated May 14, 2009 (DE 98). 
Plaintiffs contended that the waiver of the 7-hour deposition limit set forth i

finding, any lack of discovery on the issue of sexual history does not support an additional four 
hours of deposition of Jane Doe No. 4. Indeed, it may be anticipated that Epstein's counsel will 
use this additional time for abusive questioning on Jane Doe No. 4's sexual history. 12
Finally, it should be noted that this is not a document driven commercial or employment 
case, where the need for a lengthy deposition of a party may be supported with cause. See 
Dunkin Donuts. Inc. v. Mary's Donuts. Inc. 206 F.R.D. 518, 522 (S.D.Fla. 2002), (allowing the 
plaintiff to depose the defendant's accountant and corporate representative for an additional 
seven hours because it was a complex commercial case involving seven years of commercial 
activity and 10,000 pages of documents). att gm Pace v. City of Palmetto 2007 WL 470477 
(S.D.Fla. 2007) (granting one hour additional deposition time because the deponent had not read 
documents in advance, and was taking an inordinate amount of time during the deposition to read 
documents). In such a case, it may be anticipated that there will be little if any prejudice or 
damage to the party witness created by a lengthy deposition exceeding one day. In stark 
contrast, the depositions of the Plaintiffs in these cases covers the most intimate and private 
details of their lives. Particularly given the harassing and badgering questioning engaged in by

Epstein v Rothstein, Edwards 
Case No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG 
Second Amended Complaint 
(1) 
Deposing three airplane pilots employed by Epstein, and seeking a 
deposition of a fourth pilot; collectively, the three were deposed for over twelve hours but were 
not asked a single question relating to any of the claims of Edwards' clients. Instead they were 
asked many inflammatory questions that had no legitimate legal purpose; 
(2) 
Noticing and subpoenaing for deposition the following people: 
(a) 
Donald Trump (a real estate investor and television 
personality); 
Alan Dershowitz (a renowned Harvard Law Professor and one of 
Epstein's criminal defense lawyers); 
(c) 
David Copperfield (illusionist); 
(d) 
Individuals who had knowledge of Epstein's charitable, 
political or other donations; 
(e) 
Leslie Wexner, a. client of the Plaintiff; 
(3) 
Taking the deposition of Mark Epstein, brother of the Plaintiff, but not 
asking any questions about Edwards' clients; 
Edwards targeted the foregoing individuals because they were close to Epstein, not because they 
had any connection to, or knowledge of, the claims of Edwards' clients. Edwards' intent was to 
harass Epstein's friends, family and acquaintances. 
(4) 
Asking outrageous questions of the Plaintiff in depositions which had no 
legitimate bearing on the cases or the issues to be tried, including questions regarding the size of 
his genitalia, whether witnesses would leave their children alone with the Plaintiff,

sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club; (d) Jane Doe No. 102's complaint alleged that Jane Doe 
102 was initially approached at Trump's Maralago by Ohislaine Maxwell and recruited to be Maxwell 
and Epstein's underage sex slave; (e) Mark Epstein (Jeffrrey Epstein's brother) testified that Trump 
flew on Jeffrey Epstein's plane with him (the same plane that Jane Doe 102 alleged was used to have 
sex with underage girls); (f) Trump had been to Epstein's home in Palm Beach; (g) Epstein's phone 
directory from his computer contains 14 phone numbers for Donald Trump, including emergency 
numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump's security guard and houseman. 
Based on this 
information, Edwards reasonably believed that Trump might have relevant information to provide in 
the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and accordingly provided notice of a possible deposition. See 
deposition of Mark Epstein, September 21, 2009, at 48-50 (Deposition Attachment #19); See Jane Doe

Edwards

for many years; (b) in one news article Dershowitz comments that, "I'm on my 20th book... The only

12. In light of information I received suggesting that British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, 
former girlfriend and long-time friend of Epstein's, was involved in managing Epstein's 
affairs and companies I had her served for deposition for August 17, 2009. (Deposition 
Notice attached to Statement of Undisputed Facts as Exhibit BB). Maxwell was 
represented by Brett Jaffe of the New York firm of Cohen and Gressel-, and I 
understood that her attorney was paid for (directly or indirectly) by Epstein. She was 
reluctant to give her deposition, and I tried to work with her attorney to take her 
deposition on terms that would be acceptable to both sides. 
Her attorney and I 
negotiated a confidentiality agreement, under which Maxwell agreed to drop any 
objections to the deposition. Maxwell, however, still avoided the deposition. On June 
29, 2010, one day before I was to fly to NY to take Maxwell's deposition, her attorney 
informed me that Maxwell's mother was deathly ill and Maxwell was consequently 
flying to England with no intention of returning and certainly would not return to the 
United States before the conclusion of Jane Doe's trial period (August 6, 2010). 
Despite that assertion, I later learned that Ghislaine Maxwell was in fact in the country 
on approximately July 31, 2010, as she attended the wedding of Chelsea Clinton 
(former President Clinton's daughter) and was captured in a photograph taken for US 
Weekly magazine.

Thanks for all your work on this project. I few things from my review, though I'll likely send some additional things 
tomorrow: 
• The Matthew Osowski folder contains just one report, and I think that goes in the 
folder instead. 
Please move it and delete his folder. Same thing for the Tristen Peklo folder. 
• 
are the same person and the folders can be merged under the name 
• 
is the same person as =M
e a potential testifying witness. Could you please move those 
materials and delete the folder? 
• The stuff in the 
folder should actually go in the 
folder, and you can delete 
the one for IM once the stuff is moved over. 
• In the 
folder, there's a transcript of a deposition of Mark Epstein. Could you please move that into a 
new, NTW folder for him? 
• 
and 
could you please 
move these to the not-a-witness folder you created? We'll deal with the content

Epstein v Rothstein, Edwards 
Case No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG 
Second Amended Complaint 
own pockets, and those of his cohorts. 
The federal government called RRA a criminal 
enterprise. 
COUNT I: 
ABUSE OF PROCESS - EDWARDS 
29. 
Plaintiff realleges each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 28 
as if they were fully set forth here. 
30. 
Edwards made illegal, improper and perverted use of the civil process by utilizing 
it to conduct unreasonable and unnecessary "discovery," and by making unfounded allegations, 
and improper motion practice, including but not limited to: 
(1) 
Deposing three airplane pilots employed by Epstein, and seeking a 
deposition of a fourth pilot; collectively, the three were deposed for over twelve hours but were 
not asked a single question relating to any of the claims of Edwards' clients. Instead they were 
asked many inflammatory questions that had no legitimate legal purpose; 
(2) 
Noticing and subpoenaeing for deposition the following people: 
(a) 
Donald Trump (a real estate investor and television 
personality); 
(b) 
Alan Dershowitz (a renowned Harvard Law Professor and one of 
Epstein's criminal defense lawyers); 
(c) 
David Copperfield (illusionist); 
(d) 
Individuals who had knowledge of Epstein's charitable, 
political or other donations; 
(e) 
Leslie Wexner, a. client of the Plaintiff. 
(3) 
Taking the deposition of Mark Epstein, brother of the Plaintiff, but 
not asking any questions about Edwards' clients' 
Edwards
