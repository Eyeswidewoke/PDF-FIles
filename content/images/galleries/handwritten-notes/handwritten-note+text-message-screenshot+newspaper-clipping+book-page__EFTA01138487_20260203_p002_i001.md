'honc 
Envo e de 111011 II 
Dogs are welcome in this hotel. 
We never had a dog that 
smoked in bed and set fire to 
the blankets. We never had a 
dog that stole our towels and 
played the T.V. too loud, or had 
a noisy fight with his traveling 
companion. We never had a 
dog that got drunk and broke 
up the furniture....So if your 
dog can vouch for you, you're 
welcome too. cfAedy—as.,—,,,
