CARING FOR YOUR LINENS 
D. Porthault linens will last for years with gentle care. Proper cleaning and storage will prolong 
their life and ensure they retain their heirloom quality. Your linens exist to be enjoyed, and you 
should always feel comfortable using and caring for them. Like fine silver or pearls, the more 
you use your linens the more luminous and precious they will become. 
Sheets, Pillow Shams and Duvet Covers 
All D. Porthault bedding is woven of 100% Egyptian cotton or Belgian linen on extra wide looms 
and cut generously. Some shrinkage of the natural fibers is normal, but that has been taken into 
consideration in production, and you will always have abundant fabric. 
Washing 
A first wash is important for your new linens and prepares them for a long and 
beautiful life. Unfold your linens before loading them into the washing machine, and 
begin the first wash with a pre-soak in cold water and a small amount of liquid 
detergent. After this soak cycle, run a wash cycle at low temperature, again using very 
little liquid detergent, followed by a cold water rinse. If your washer does not have a 
pre-wash/soak cycle, we suggest a hand-soaking for your first wash. 
On succeeding washes, machine wash your linens in warm (not hot) water* and follow 
with a full, cool rinse. Always select a gentle wash and spin cycle. Separate bright colors 
from whites, and remember to include only natural sheeting fabrics in your wash. 
(Synthetics, if co-mingled, can cause pilling in your natural linens.) 
As with the first wash, unfold or loosely shake open your linens before loading, and 
never fully pack the washer tub. 
Pillow shams and duvet covers with delicate embellishments can be washed inside out, 
and small items with lace trims can be placed in mesh bags for further protection. You 
can frequently dispense with the spin cycle for delicate linens.
