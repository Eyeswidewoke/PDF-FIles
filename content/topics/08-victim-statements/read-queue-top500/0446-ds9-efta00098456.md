She is the victim of an international sex trafficking crime in London shortly before March 13, 2001. In the following weeks (and much earlier), the crimes also continued into the United States, specifically New York City, New York, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The perpetrators of these crimes include: (1) Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire (and convicted sex offender) who is a citizen of the United States residin

Other events of a similar nature took place in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is my understanding that the activities of Epstein and Maxwell outlined above would be a violation of American criminal laws, including the American prohibition of transporting minors internationally for sexual purposes contained in 18 U.S. Code § 1591. I am not an expert on the applicable laws in the United Kingdom, but it seems like the same type of criminal offenses may exist there as well. In America, there is no statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors. It is possible that the law there in the United Kingdom is similar on this point as well. In 20

In fact, his only similarity with Epstein and the only link to their friendship appeared to be that Brunel could get dozens of underage girls and feed Epstein's (and Maxwell's) strong appetite for sex with minors. 48. Brunel ran some kind of modeling agency and appeared to have an arrangement with the U.S. Government where he could get passports or other travel documents for young girls. He would then bring these young girls (girls ranging in age from 12 to 24) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends, including Epstein. 49. Brunel would offer the girls "modeling"

On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to as "Epstein) entered a plea of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony solicitation of prostitution) and 796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution). in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cf-009454A7OO(MB and 2008-cf- 00938 lAXXXMB) and was sentenced to a term of twelve months' imprisonment to be followed by an additional six months' imprisonment, followed by twelve months of Community Control 1, with conditions of community confinement imposed by the Court.

Epstein's code word for sexual encounters was that it was a "massage". At times the interaction between Epstein and the girls would start in a massage room setting, it was always a sexual encounter and never just a massage. 19. In addition to constantly finding underage girls to satisfy their personal desires, Epstein and Maxwell also got girls for Epstein's friends and acquaintances. Epstein specifically told me that the reason for him doing this was so that they would "owe him," they would "be in his pocket," and he would "have something on them." I understood him to mean that when someone was in his pocket, they owed him favors. I also understood that Eps

One way to describe Maxwell's role was as the "madame." She assumed a position of trust for all the girls, including me. She got me to trust her and Epstein. It turned out that Maxwell was all about sex all the time. She had sex with underage girls virtually every day when I was around her, and she was very forceful. 22. I first had sexual activities with her when I was approximately 15 at the Palm Beach mansion. I had many sexual activities with her over the next several years in Epstein's various residences plus other exotic locations.
