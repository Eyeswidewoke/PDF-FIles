Fisher University of California, Los Angeles & Florida International University To appear in: Michel St. Yves (Ed.), Investigative Interviewing: Handbook of Best Practices. Thomson Reuters Publishers, Toronto, 2014. Information is the lifeblood of investigations and it is the ability of investigators to obtain useful and accurate information from victims and witnesses that is most crucial for case solution and effective criminal prosecution. Yet full and accurate memory recall is difficult to achieve during a police interview. We have spent much of the past 25-30 years addressing this issue. In this chapter, we begin by describing a typical police interview, followed by an overview of the origins and underpinnings of the Cognitive Interview

EFTA01657015 3 Origins and Underpinnings of the CI In the early 1980s, a constellation of factors contributed to the development and eventual refinement of the CI techniques for investigative interviewing. First, the U.S. Department of Justice set out to fund an effort to produce a protocol for use by law enforcement for purposes of interviewing victims and witnesses of crime (National Institute of Justice - Geiselman & Fisher, 1985). The most notable police procedure at the time was the Reid and Associates confrontational interrogation technique for use with suspects (Inbau, Reid, Buckley, & Jayne, 2001), not for use with witnesses and victims. Second, the one innovative technique employed by law enforcement at the time, forensic hypnosis,

Second, the one innovative technique employed by law enforcement at the time, forensic hypnosis, was becoming mired in legal issues (e.g., People v Shirley, 1982; Sanders & Simmons, 1983). Third, the RAND Corporation (1975) had just completed a survey of law-enforcement professionals and found that 85% of what police do on a daily basis is talk to citizens, whereas only 2% of the respondent

The sequence of the CI protocol provides a general framework for conducting an investigative interview of most persons including civilian eyewitnesses, victims, police, and more recently, suspects. However, it is important to understand that interviewers must be flexible and alter their approaches to meet the needs of each witness rather than to use a rigid template, causing the witness to adapt. In this regard, the CI should be seen as a toolbox of techniques that can be drawn upon as the situation presents itself. The CI is more of a set of gene

The introduction establishes the appropriate psychological states and interpersonal dynamics to promote efficient memory recall and communication during the remainder of the interview. Victims and witnesses often will be anxious about the interview process because they are uncertain about what is expected of them and how the process will transpire (Sydeman, Cascardi, Poythress, & Ritterbrand, 1997). CI interviewers attempt to reduce this uncertainty by previewing the structure of the interview, and especially by explaining the witness-centered nature of the interview. Furthermore,

The benefits of developing rapport include freeing the witness of some anxiety about being interviewed that might otherwise consume some of the witness's cognitive resources. Furthermore, the interviewer must interact with the victim not merely as a source of evidence that can be applied toward solving the crime. Rather, the interviewer should express his/her concern about the victim's plight, as a person who has undergone a potentially life-altering experience (Fisher & Geiselman, 2010). Transfer Control. The interviewer generally has higher social or expert status, which normally dictates that that the interviewer shou
