   > s actions were undertaken "knowingly". To the extent we can determine the facts, it appears that prior to a case being brought, in each instance multiple explicit (and recorded) conversations were had, so there could be no question as to when the inducement was attempted, whether the inducement was of explicit unlawful sexual activity, or what the defendant's belief wasas to the age of the . victim. Again, this has no applicability to the facts alleged here. The data is informative in other ways, as well. Though there are a handful of cases in which the telephone is one of a multiple of means of interstate communications allegedly used, in only two such cases, both far different from the facts here,; was the use of the telephone the sole means of the wrongdoing alleged.

   > aw. We u focused on the evidence which reflects the sworn statement of, for example, who told state investigators that she was asked to find women between 18 and 20 who would provide Mr. Epstein with topless massages and which sometimes involved their being touched. Fla. Stat. Ann. §796.07, a general statute which proscribes "prostitution" and "lewdness", regardless of whether an adult or minor is involved, is of very limited applicability here. That statute's definition of "prostitution" excludes conduct of which there may be evidence, specifically, a man masturbating himself while touching the breasts of another. Section 796.07(1Xa) defines "prostitution" as the giving or receiving of the body for sexual activity for hire. "Sexual activity" is defined to include "the handling or f

   > Nor does that statute make h a crime to touch the breasts or other private areas of someone between 16 and 18. Id. And, of course, even if a state crime was committed, which we surely do not concede, that does not make out a federal crime, unless it could be proven that the defendant knowingly induced an illegal aet over the telephone. Moreover, at best, the proof would show that only a small minority of massages'resulted in what may possibly be characterized as sexual activity with a woman under the age of 18. But even where a massage involved sexual activity with a woman under 18, to the extent Mr. Epstein did not know the woman was under 18, or the telephone call did not induce the activity, or Mr. Epstein did not intend the sexual activity at the time the telephone call arranging th
