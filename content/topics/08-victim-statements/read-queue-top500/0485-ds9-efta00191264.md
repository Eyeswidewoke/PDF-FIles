Jane Doe #2 actively avoided law enforcement's attempts to secure her cooperation with the investigation and contacted other potential witnesses and victims to advise them against cooperating with the authorities.

At the time that the investigation was opened, the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office had presented evidence to a state grand jury, which had returned an EFTA00191285 indictment charging solicitation of prostitution. That charge made no reference to the ages of the minor victims and, upon conviction, did not require sex offender registration. 3.

Black, a partner at Black, Srebnick, Komspan & Stumpf in Miami, said the 23-page opinion issued Friday has wider implications in plea bargains.

Plea bargain The appellate case stems from a decision by federal prosecutors not to charge Epstein if he pleaded guilty to state charges in Palm Beach Circuit Court for soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail and house arrest. Epstein moved back to New York City from Palm Beach after he finished his sentence. The women contend they could have argued against the nonprosecution agreement if they were informed before the agreement was reached.
