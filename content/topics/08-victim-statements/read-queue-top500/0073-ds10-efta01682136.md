The panel was chosen from a pool of 120 prospective jurors after three days of painstaking questioning. Among the questions was whether any- body in the jury pool or their family members had been crime victims. "She flat-out should be charged with perjury," said prosecutor Craig Williams. "She should be made an ex- ample of." The Lamb trial unraveled less than two hours before attorneys were to deliver opening arguments, when a woman in the jury pool who was not selected for the panel phoned the jury administra- tion office and the office of the trial judge, Circuit Judge Lucy Chernow &ow

And it increases the difficulty of prosecuting child sex abuse cases, especially when the defendant is enormously wealthy and can hire high- priced, top-tier lawyers. At least one of Epstein's alleged victims told police he knew she was underage when the two of them got naked for massages and sex- ual activity. She was 16 years old at the time and said Ep- stein asked her questions about her high school, ac- cording to police reports.

Epstein's youngest al- leged victim was 14 when she says she gave him a massage that included some sexual activity. She is now 16. The girl's father says he doesn't know whether she told Ep- stein her age. "My daughter has kept a lot of what happened from me because of sheer embarrass- ment," he said.

Epstein hived Harvard law Professor Alan Der- showitz when he became aware he was under investi- gation, and Dershowitz gave prosecutors information that some of the alleged victims : had spoke of using alcohol and marijuana on a popular Web site, according to a Palm Reach police report.
