The Conduct b Not a Reekterahle Offense Under Florida la Under the Agreement. Mr. Epstein is to plead guilty to an indictment charging one count of Florida Statute § 796.07. solicitation of prostitution. and to one count of Florida Statute * 796.03. procuring n minor for prostitution. Given the commercial nature of the conduct generally associated with § 796.03. a defendant convicted under this statute must register as a sexual offender under Florida's Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (the "Florida's Sex Act"). However. Mr. Epstein's alleged conduct does not meet the requirements of § 796.03, or for that matter. any of the other Florida stat

Ms. Villafana maintained (and continued to maintain as late as last week). that a § 796.03 charge involved the solicitation of a minor, not the procurement of a minor. During those negotiations. we repeatedly asked Ms. Villafana to confirm that she possessed the requisite evidence to make out a registerable charge. to which she unwaveringly replied that she did in fact possess this evidence.

We were then informed by lama I3etohlavek that solicitation of a minor is not a registemble offense. and we promptly made that known to Ms. Villafana.
