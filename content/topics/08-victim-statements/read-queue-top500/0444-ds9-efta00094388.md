I can still remember watching myself on those screens as I walked into the house of the person I came to know as a predator, a pedophile, my rapist. I'm filing a civil action against Jeffrey Epstein's estate and accomplices today, under New York's Child Victims Act. A key provision of the law goes into effect today and allows survivors to revive claims if the statute of limitations had expired. Epstein was found dead, apparently by suicide, in his jail cell last week. I'm angry he won't have to personally answer to me in the court of law. But my quest for justice is just getting started. During my freshman year, one of Epstein's recruiters, a stran

I want my story to hold Epstein to account and also his recruiters, the workers on his payroll who knew what he was doing and the prominent people around him who helped conceal and perpetuate his sex-trafficking scheme. Their hideous actions victimized me and so many young girls like me. For years I felt crushed by the power imbalance between Epstein, with his enablers, and me.

Yet in a 2009 deposition, Mark said that he knew Donald Trump flew on Jeffrey's plane "numerous times" and that he'd personally seen Trump on his brother's plane once. "They were good friends," Mark recently told the Washington Post. "I know [Trump] is trying to distance himself, but they were." After Jeffrey pleaded not guilty last month to sex trafficking of minors, Mark offered his Florida home to guarantee his brother's bond. Last month, Mark told Crain's New York that he had no business connection to his brother, but documents show that Mark's real-estate business, Ossa Properties, is linked to J. Epstein & Co., the company through which Jeffrey managed retail billionaire Leslie Wexner's assets. The person in charge of running Ossa Properties, Jonat

Mark told Crain's that the connection between the two companies was "a mistake," reminiscent of the "recording error" that linked private-equity tycoon Leon Black's foundation to Jeffrey years after he was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida. At the center of the curious connection between Mark's real-estate company and his brother is a condominium at 301 East 66th Street, a 15-minute walk from Jeffrey's mansion on East 70th Street. Mark owns the majority of the units in the bland, 16-story, 200-unit building, which he purchased from Wexner in the early 1990s. Mark has said his brother does not own a

Sprecher's townhome is currently on the market for nearly $3.7 million. 16 EFTA00094403 SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, August 14, 2019 Sprecher, who has been married for 25 years and has two adult children, also was barred by the judge from perusing any kind of porn and ordered "to avoid all unsupervised contact with minors." Prosecutors argued that he should be fitted with a monitoring device, too, but the judge refused. Sprecher was released on $100,000 bond and ordered back to court Sept 12. His lawyer declined comment after the hearing. In 2012, Sprecher and "Rebecca" co-producer Louise Forlenza were scammed by former Long Island stockbroker Mark Hotton, who netted $60,000 in fees from them with promises o

"Mr. Sprecher works as a producer," Cohen said, adding that his client needed to be able to set up meetings and read email. "He doesn't seem to be doing too much these days," Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman said. He ordered Sprecher not use the intemet or have unsupervised interactions with minors. Despite his extensive credits, Sprecher is probably best known for his involvement in the "Rebecca" debacle in 2012. Sprecher thought he had lined up financial backing for a Broadway run of the musical, only to learn he had been tricked. A con man, Mark Hotton, had fabricated the existence of a South African investor who 18 EFTA00094405 SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, August 14, 2019 suppose

The investigation is claimed to have revealed that Epstein had engaged in similar behavior with multiple underage girls and had organized a sex ring where minor girls allegedly were "lent" to other individuals. The FBI's investigation led to the preparation of a 53-page indictment against Epstein. The indictment was never presented to a grand jury, however. In 2008, federal prosecutors, led by Acosta, negotiated a non- prosecution agreement with Epstein which allowed him to plead guilty in state court to lesser charges of soliciting a minor for prosti

Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, has vowed to continue the investigation into Epstein, who, at the time of his death, was in a New York facility awaiting trial on allegations he operated an underage sex trafficking ring. And even though Epstein is now firmly outside the grip of the criminal justice system, his alleged "co-conspirators" do not enjoy a similar reprieve. Several of Epstein's accusers have pointed to Maxwell as playing a pivotal role in enlisting his victims, according to thousands of pages of court documents unsealed on Friday -- just hours before Epstein reportedly used hi

The 57-year-old British socialite is in a relationship with tech CEO Scott Borgerson, 43, with whom she is living in the $3 million oceanfront home at the end of a long private road in Manchester-by-the-Sea, the Daily Mail reported Wednesday.

(The Daily Beast recently reported that Mark also began dabbling in the modeling industry around the same time Jeffrey invested in MC2.) In 2010, a former MC2 employee said in a sworn statement that the MC2 models were in fact victims of Epstein's underage sex-trafficking ring. "Jeffrey rents several apartments there where he keeps his girls, alleged models for the MC2 agency he owns," Florida attorney Brad Edwards, who represents a number of Epstein's alleged victims, told "Page Six" in 2009. "But Mark acts like he doesn't even know his brother." 12 EFTA00094399 SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, August 14, 2019 In addition to the models, the Jeff

Albert 8/14/19 The significance of the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), which is intended to guarantee crime victims a role in federal criminal proceedings, has been highlighted in the case of Jeffrey E. Epstein, the financier accused of sexually trafficking underage girls. Because the government's noncompliance with the CVRA in negotiating Epstein's plea deal in 2008 led to the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander R. Acosta, losing his cabinet position as Secretary of Labor, practitioners can expect prosecutors and judges to be more focused on the CVRA going forward.
