The petition, accordingly, does not specifically discuss the Government's concealment of the NPA. To conform to that important fact in this case, it appears desirable to amend the petition to address the NPA. With regard to amending to add new victims, the Government has argued that Rule 15 (addressing amending pleadings) rather than Rule 21 (addressing joinder of parties) is the applicable rule. While the victims have contested that view in their concurrently-filed Rule 21 1 EFTA01626115 Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 311 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2015 Page 2 of 21 reply brief, out of an abundance of caution, they explain here why

In addition, Rule 15(c)( I) allows an amended pleading to "relate back" to the date of an initial pleading, provided that

In addition, Rule 15(c)( I) allows an amended pleading to "relate back" to the date of an initial pleading, provided that the amendment asserts a claim "that arose out of the conduct, transaction or occurrence set out . . . in the original pleading." Because the original petition in this case alleged that the Government violated the rights of all the girls who were Jeffrey Epstein's victims, the proposed amendment in this case would relate back to the date the petition was filed: July 7, 2008. This relation back eliminates any statute of limitations or other timelessness concerns. FACTUAL BACKGROUND On July 7, 2008, Jane Doe No. I filed a petition under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771. See DE 1. She sought to enforce both her CVRA rights — and the right

The reply went on to explain that the agreement "remarkably allowed the defendant — a billionaire with extraordinary political connections — to escape all federal prosecutions for dozens of serious federal sex offenses against minors." Id. at 1-2. The reply explained the relief sought, specifically that "[t]he Court should therefore declare the proposed non-prosecution agreement an illegal one, since it was reached in violation of the CVRA, and order the Government to confer with Petitioner and the other victims in this matter before reaching any disposition in this case." Id. at 2 (emphasis added). The reply asked the C

Of course, "undue" delay requires some reference to some time when the new victims' claims were, in fact, due. As discussed in the victims' contemporaneously-filed reply regarding Rule 21, the statute of limitations for the crimes against minors at issue here has not yet expired. See 18 U.S.C. § 3283. And Congress has not seen fit to set a more restrictive time limit for victims to file CVRA enforcement actions, either in the CVRA itself or in civil statutes of limitations. Assessed under these congressional decisions, the motion to amend has not been unduly delayed. Even more important, this Court has not yet set a time limit for a

In addition to discussing the situation of the two petitioners, the motion also raised very specific allegations about Jane Doe No. 3, i.e., that "Jeffrey Epstein flew at least one underage girl on his private jet for the purpose of forcing her to have sex with him and others. Epstein forced this underage girl to be sexually exploited by his adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, businessmen, and professional and personal acquaintances."
