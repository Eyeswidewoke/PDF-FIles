   > age 2 of 19 CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-MARRA/JOHNSON BACKGROUND Federal Rule of Evidence 415 Jane Doe provides this notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 415. Congress added Rule 415 into the federal rules in 1994. The rule makes evidence of other acts of sexual assault or child molestation automatically admissible in any cases (like Jane Doe's) involving allegations of sexual assault by a victim. Congress explained that "Nhe reform effected by these rules is critical to the protection of the public from rapists and child molesters, and is justified by the distinctive characteristics of the cases to which it applies. In child molestation cases, for example, a history of similar acts tends to be exceptionally probative because it shows an unusual disposition of the defendant -- a se

   > rs, and is justified by the distinctive characteristics of the cases to which it applies. In child molestation cases, for example, a history of similar acts tends to be exceptionally probative because it shows an unusual disposition of the defendant -- a sexual or sado-sexual interest in children -- that simply does not exist in ordinary people. Moreover, such cases require reliance on child victims whose credibility can readily be attacked in the absence of substantial corroboration. In such cases, there is a compelling public interest in admitting all significant evidence that will shed some light on the credibility of the charge and any denial by the defense." 140 CONG. REC. S12990-01,S12990 (Sept. 20, 1994) (statement of Sen. Dole). Congress also asked that the rule be liberally c

Moreover, Epstein has obtained ample advanced notice of the substance of the testimony of the girls who will testify against him. These girls were the victims in the criminal investigation against him that was prosecuted by the State and Federal government. Epstein has received the Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report, many of their statements to local police and FBI, and a list of approximately 40 underage minor victims was provided to him by the United States Attorney's Office as an addendum to the Non-Prosecution Agreement.

Plaintiff Jane Doe will testify that she was at defendant Epstein's home on numerous occasions between 2003 and 2005, beginning at a time when she was 14 years old. She was brought to his house by another underage minor victim of Epstein, consistent with Epstein's designed scheme to access underage minors for sex. She was taken up to Epstein's bedroom, and he told her to undress and massage him. Then he rolled over and began masturbating as he also touched Jane Doe's naked breasts, buttocks and vagina. At times Epstein inserted his fingers into her vagina and used a vibrator on Jane Doe's vagina. He and his assista

NOTICE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF TESTIMONY TO BE OFFERED Jane Doe intends to offer two forms of testimony about other acts of sexual abuse by Epstein: direct and indirect. Direct testimony will come from then-minor girls who were sexually abused by Epstein and from Epstein himself. (Jane Doe intends to ask Epstein at trial whether the girls' testimony about his abuse was accurate; Epstein will then need to either fully confirm directly the accuracy of their testimony or, as he has 7 EFTA00222654 Case 9:08-cv-80893-KAM Document 197 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/02/2010 Page 8 of 19 CASE NO: 08-CV-80893-M
