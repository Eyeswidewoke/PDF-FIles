During the massages, Epstein would have the girls take off some or all of their clothes, and then he would escalate the sexual nature of the massages, either during the first encounter or during subsequent encounters.

She traveled extensively with Epstein and is reported to have had a sexual relationship with him and/or with certain underage girls.
