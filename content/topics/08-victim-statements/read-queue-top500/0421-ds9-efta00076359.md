The defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated testimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to prison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which remain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation of witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports about his conduct reemerg

He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation of witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports about his conduct reemerged. And he continues to show a shocking lack of understanding of the gravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and casual disparagement of victims in his arguments. Against this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges, and the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions that are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant EFTA00076359 Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 11 Filed 07/12/19 Page 2 of 14 Honorable Richard M

Among other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the principal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to forfeiture upon the defendant's conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His proposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be little comfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to this country. The promise to "deregister or otherwise ground" his private jet is meaningless given his wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel.

The two co-signers he proposes only further highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the District. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing— and does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has continued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he proposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar circumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he can be secured at all times: a federal correctional center. The defendant faces a presump

A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of minors, including girls as young as 14 years old, in New York and Florida.

Rather than even attempting to address the grave risks of releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors, the defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to little more than a barely-secured bond masquerading as a 14-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant's application and order him detained pending trial.

As charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the defendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact

The defendant's victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young as 14 years old when he abused them.

Indeed, that evidence, already robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is growing stronger by the day. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions, have identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when they were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government has discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young women and girls in the defendant's Manhattan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens of electronic discs that contain still more such photos? And dozens of individuals have called the Government in recent days to co

Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the defendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with victims' genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant actively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He paid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him, creating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.
