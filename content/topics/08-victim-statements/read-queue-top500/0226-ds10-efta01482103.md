We believe actions were taken in those cases that were an abuse of process to inflate the marketing." Edwards filed a counterclaim, alleging Epstein filed a frivolous lawsuit to get him to back down from representing the victims. Epstein had filed a complaint with the Florida Bar against Edwards, raising allegations that Edwards and others were involved in Rothstein's wrongdoing. After investigating the claim, the Florida Bar dismissed the complaint.
