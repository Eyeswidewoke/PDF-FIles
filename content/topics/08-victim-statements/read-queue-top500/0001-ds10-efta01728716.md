Starting in the 1990s, home computers, online services, and the Internet have become new points of contact and technological tools. Although most of the offenders currently utilizing computers in their sexual victimization of children would generally be considered to be "acquaintance molesters," some might be family members and others might be strangers. Some of these offenders might also be sexually victimizing children without using com- puters.

Although it is the focus of this discussion, the focus of the investigation cannot be only on the computer. The computer is only a tool. Also, as the capabilities and availability of computers change, their role in the sexual victimization of children will also change. Some may wonder why a discussion of acquaintance molesters would include a section on the use of computers. That is because, like most acquain- tance molesters, individuals attempting to sexually exploit children through the use of computer online services or the Internet tend to gradually seduce their targets through the use of attention, affection, kindn

They are often willing to devote considerable amounts of time, money, and energy to this process. They will listen to and empathize with the problems of children. They will be aware of the music, hobbies, and interests of children. Unless the victims are already engaged in sexually explicit computer conversation, offenders will usually lower any inhibitions by gradually introduc- ing the sexual context and content. Some offenders use the computer primarily to collect and trade child pornography, while others seek online contact with other offenders and children. Some do both. Offenders who do either or both with a computer can also do ei

Adoles- cents may also be attracted to and lured by online offenders closer to their age who, although not technically "pedophiles," may be dangerous. • Illegal Sexual Activity Computer-related sexual exploitation of children usually comes to the attention of law enforcement as a result of individual/victim complaints, referrals from CHILD MOLESTERS: A BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS - 89 EFTA01728717 commercial service providers, and inadvertent discovery during other investiga- tions. Increasingly, cases are being proactively identified as a result of undercover investigations that target high-risk computer sites or utilize other specialized tech- niques.

Exploitation cases involving computers present many investigative challenges, but they also present the opportunity to obtain a great deal of corroborative evidence and investigative intelligence. This discussion will focus primarily on the dynamics of offender and victim behavior in the computer exploitation of children. Computer Offenders Offenders using computers to sexually exploit children tend to fall into the three broad categories of situational, prefer- ential, and miscellaneous "offenders." Situational Offenders Situational offenders include a ■ "normal" adolescent/adult - usually a typical adolescent searching online for pornography and sex or a

Searching a computer for this varied adult-theme pornography can sometimes be justified if it helps identify the person using the computer or is linked to and helps explain the victimization of children. If children are directly molested, the diverse offender is more likely to victimize pubescent children.

Do they have a professional use for 92 - CHILD MOLESTERS: A BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS EFTA01728720 the material, and were they using it professionally? Both standards must be met in order to seriously consider the claim.

   > to engage in sexual activity. Cases involving adolescents using the computer to solicit sex with other ado- lescents and traffic in child pornography that portrays pubescent "children" are a problem area for the criminal-justice system especially the federal system. For purposes of illegal sexual activity and child pornography, the federal statutes and many local statutes define children or minors as individuals who have not yet reached their sixteenth or eighteenth birthdays. Such behavior, therefore, may be technically illegal, but may not be sexually deviant. Legal Sexual Activity Sexual activity involving the use of computers that may be of concern, but is usually legal includes ■ validating sexually deviant behavior and interests ■ reinforcing deviant arousal patterns ■ stori

If the child victim states one thing but feels differently, "participating" in the investigation in this way could lead to the child "tipping off" the alleged offender or more serious consequences for the child ranging from further victimization to suicide. The use of this technique usually should be discussed with the parents of a victim who is a minor. The parent, however, might not be trusted to be discreet about the use of this technique or even be a suspect in the investigation. Although there is the potential for further emotional trauma, many victims afterward describe an almost therapeutic sense of empowerment or return of control through their participation in pretext telephone calls.

Parents must be told that in the absence of some extraordinary circumstance investigators need to interview their children outside of their presence. In some cases departmental policy or the law may give parents the right to be present during the interview of their minor children. If that is the situation, every effort should be made to get parental and/or departmental permission to waive that right. If parents are present during the interviews, any information so obtained must be carefully assessed and evaluated with the understanding of the parents' potentially significant influence on their children's statements.

If the case has been put together properly, however, when the dust settles, most of these offenders plead guilty. Confronted with overwhelming evidence, many child molesters prefer to plead guilty to charges with vague names (e.g., contributing to the delinquency of minors, lewd and lascivious conduct, indecent liberties) so that the public will not know what they really did. The last thing they want is all the details of their behavior to come out in open court. They work the best plea bargain they can, say they are guilty when the judge asks, and then tell everyone else why they are really not guilty. 132 - CHILD MOLESTERS: A BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS EFTA017287

If adolescents are considered child victims of sexual exploitation, then their needs, interests, and desires must be realistically recognized and understood when addressing the problem. Legal definitions of who is considered a child or minor vary from state-to-state and even statute-to-statute when dealing with adolescent victims. During a prosecution, the definition can even vary from count-to-count in the same indictment. The age of the child may determine whether certain sexual activity is a misdemeanor or felony and what degree felony.

To legally determine who is a child, investigators and prosecutors turn to the law. That is, the penal code will legally define who is a child or minor. But they must still deal with their own perceptions as well as those of other professionals, juries, and society as a whole. In general, a child will be defined for this discussion as someone who has not yet reached his or her eighteenth birthday. One of the problems in using this broad, but sentimentally appealing, definition of a child is that it lumps together individuals who may be more

If you change it again and make the victim 13, 14, 15, or 16 years old, the response of society and the law would vary greatly. For example, those interested in minimizing such sexual activity might emphasize referring to the victims as minors rather than as children. In sex crimes, the fundamental legal difference between victimization of an adult and a child is the issue of consent. In cases of sexual activity between adults, with a few rare exceptions, a lack of consent must be established for there to be a crime. In sexual activity between children and adults, a crime can exist even if the child cooperates or "consents." But

It is often based on the fact that the offender preferred pubescent children. One forensic evaluation I reviewed for a prosecutor stated that the defendant was not a pedophile because he had a sexual preference for "underage adults." Some- times the lack of a diagnosis of pedophilia is corroborative and may help the prosecution if admitted. If the allegations indicate the situational, nonpreferential selection of a child victim, the lack of pedophilia is consistent with the facts of the case. Interestingly in the guilt or innocence phase .of most cases few of these diagnoses would be admissible. All the persiste
