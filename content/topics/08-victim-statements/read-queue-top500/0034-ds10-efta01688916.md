As the police records attest the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could 'say no" at any time during a massage as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in every victim's statement First she would be asked to remove her shirt, then her pants. He would attempt to fondle her buttocks and breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator. There was sometimes di rat enetration, and the more willing girls were lured into hill-blown sexual relations with both Epstein and who was referred to In press accounts and police reports as Epstein's Ilve-In "sex s

Ghlslaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years Epstein's live-in partner, also recruited young girls. Since his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth. The victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave them a bite to eat.

Unable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this 'golden nugget'—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with 'obstruction of official proceedings' for withholding information that could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Bea

(Guy Frostin, one of Epstein's local attomeys, told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was "very passionate" about massages being 'therapeutically and spiritually' beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage training.) Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and "deliberately engaged in a pattern of

Critton blamed attorney Spencer Kuvin for releas- ing it. Kuvin said it was public record. The civil suits began mounting after Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two state charges: procur- ing a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. He served 13 months of an 1g month sentence.

Yet the agreement allowed Epstein to plead guilty to only two lower-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor child for prostitution. Although the police Investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against Epstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal, and that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed to bankroll their civil lawsuits.
