Herman subsequently withdrew the first Jane Does lawsuit because of squabbling by her patents over the litiga- tion. The girl may refile the suit after she turns 18 in May and can make her own deci- sions, Herman said. Other alleged victims also have contartpd him, Herman said. "I do anticipate more cases," he said. In the latest litigation, Jane Doe No. 3 alleges that she was recruited lege student, to give Epste money at his waterfront home late in 2004 or early in 2005.

"This one repeats the identical allega- tions of the first three lawsuits, including the absurd demand for $50 million," Lewis said. "These women, who are not 'victims' by any stretch of the imagination, have all confessed to lying about their ages. The latest lawsuit, like the three before it, is wholly without mer- it. We will vigorously fight these allegations in court."

She felt vul- nerable." She never returned and did not tell her par- ents about the incident until a criminal inves- tigation began, he said. The girl decided to sue Epstein because she wants justice, he said. "For victims, it's very empowering to hold someone accountable," said Herman, who spe- cializes in sex abuse cases. Herman said "a number of other young girls" have contacted him with similar allega- tions against Epstein. An investigation by Palm Beach Police al- leged that Epstein induced several underage girls to give him massages at his home. He was indicted in July 2000 on one felony charge of so

After a two-day trial and one day of deliberations, the jury of seven men and five women found Muentes guilty of two counts for soliciting the services of an underage prostitute and for attempting to travel overseas for sex with a minor. Muentes, who has no criminal record or history of child abuse, faces a mandatory sentence of at least 10 years.

After Muentes indicated his interest in a prostitute, Love asked him to choose from a range of 14 to 27 years old. "Let's go young ... very young," Muentes said. Love suggested a 14- to 16-year-old and Muentes agreed. When Muentes asked about the legality of sex with a minor, Love said it was all illegal. According to testimony at trial, adult prostitution is legal in Costa Rica, but transactions cannot involve a third party, such as an agency or pimp. Markus said Muentes changed his mind and requested a 21- to 24-year-old escort, but was never given a chance to back out. Sentencing is set for May 29.

APRIL 18, 2008 WEST PALM BEACH - Part-time Palm Beach resident Jeffrey Epstein has been sued in federal court by two more women this week who say he had sexual contact with them when they gave him mas- sages at his waterfront mansion when they were minors. They are the fourth and fifth women to sue Epstein. Both women are seeking more than $50 million. Jane Doe No. 4 says she was 15 years old when she had several encounters with Epstein in 2002 or 2003. Jane Doe No. 5 says she was 15 or 16 years old when she was with him. Epstein was indicted by a county grand jury in July 2006 on a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution. That

Meanwhile, Unroch, 57, also acknowledged that his client was living with him and was at the center of a $10 million lawsuit he filed last year against a neighbor who said he was having sex with underage girls. That case is pending. ' "What she was doing at 22 is irrelevant to what hap- pened to her when she was 16," Unroch said Wednesday He went on the say he hoped Epstein would agree to "do right" by his client and re- solve the case out of court.
