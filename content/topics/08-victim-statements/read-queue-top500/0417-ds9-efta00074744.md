   > e Estate; enforce its criminal activity lien against the Estate; and ensure that the administration of the Estate conforms to the laws of the Virgin Islands. Intervention is particularly necessary given the potential conflict of interest of the Executors in administering the Estate and, in particular, in proposing to hire and compensate "Designers" to administer a voluntary fund to compensate victims trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein. The Government's Opposition to Estate's Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution is filed attached hereto as Exhibit 1. I. BACKGROUND Jeffrey Epstein was found dead on August 10, 2019, while in custody in New York for sex crimes. U.S. Virgin Islands v. Estate ofJeffrey Epstein, et at, No. ST-2020-CV-14, 7 (Super Ct. Civ.

   > uary 16, 2020, the Government filed a Criminal Activity Lien against the Estate to secure its claims against the Estate. Criminal Activity Lien Not. (Jan. 16, 2020), Exhibit 5. As the Plaintiff in that litigation, the Govemmcnt has an interest in the assets of the Estate, as well as an interest in ensuring that the laws of the Virgin Islands are enforced for the benefit of the Government and victims of Epstein's crimes. See Ex. 2. The Executors of the Estate, who are alleged to have been affiliated with various entities that participated in Epstein's criminal enterprise, cannot adequately protect the rights of the interest of the Government. Therefore, the Government should be allowed to intervene and assure assets, which are potentially subject to forfeiture and/or divesture, are prote

   > 423. The Complaint filed by the Government against the Estate and Epstein's associates and affiliates seeks to require the Estate to forfeit or divest itself of certain assets, including the two islands it owns, Little St. James and Great St. James, in favor of the Government. Ex. 2, at pp. 46-48. The lawsuit also seeks civil penalties, damages, and equitable disgorgement, including funds for victims who were trafficked and abused by Epstein in the Virgin Islands. Id. Relatedly, the Government has an interest in the Estate in order to enforce the criminal activity lien against the Estate pursuant to 14 V.I.C. § 610. See Ex. 5. In particular, Virgin Islands law states that this lien -created in favor of the Government of the Territory of the Virgin Islands shall be superior to and prior

   > er person in the personal or real property or beneficial interest in it." 14 V.I.C. § 610(f). The disposition of the Estate's assets, both through and outside of the Epstein Fund and the uncapped expenses of a Program Administrator, threatens to dissipate assets subject to the Government's CICO claims and criminal activity lien. To be clear, the Government does not seek to supplant funds that victims might receive through the Epstein Fund or otherwise, but is entitled to ensure its own legally enforceable interests in the Estate are protected. Thus, the Government faces "a substantial risk that disposition" of the Estate's assets "will impair [its] interest," satisfying the first two elements for intervention.

   > Fund, there is no obligation that the Program Administrator be subject to the legal constraints imposed by the Probate Code or the supervision or approval of this Court, and provides no assurances that the Government's substantial and legally protectable interest in the distribution of the Estate's assets will be protected. Moreover, there is no ceiling. or floor, for funds to be paid to the victims, imperiling both the Government's ability to ensure that its own claims are satisfied, and to ensure that victims receive the compensation to which they are entitled. Turning to the final element, the existing parties, the Executors in the present matter, do not adequately protect the Ciovemment's interest. Only the Government and certainly not the Estate, can ensure that its interests are

This structure is unduly coercive, and jeopardizes the potential recovery available to victims unless they immediately avail themselves of the Fund. As the Court is undoubtedly aware, many of the claims in this matter are and will be made by those who were minors at the time of Epstein's abuse. Therefore, any program proposed to compensate Epstein's victims should account for the psychological trauma of minors, who often repress memories of their abuse, by allowing them additional time for filing a claim instead of limiting the time for filing. The blatant intimidation tactics employed by Defendants in the Government's CICO action further cements the

As described below, Epstein engaged in a pattern and practice of trafficking and sexually abusing young women and female children on this private, secluded island of Little St. James where Epstein and his associates could avoid detection of their illegal activity from Virgin Islands and federal law enforcement and prevent these young women and underage girls from leaving freely and escaping the abuse. 24. Thus, Nautilus, Inc. participated in carrying out, facilitating and concealing Epstein's crimes, hence Little St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. 25.
