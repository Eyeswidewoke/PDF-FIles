   > rach Post Staff Writer WEST PALM BEACH — The parents of a teenage girl sued part-time Palm Beach resi- dent Jeffrey Epstein for more than $50 million on Thursday. alleging that the wealthy money manager had her brought to his mansion for a massage, then engaged in sexual activity with her. The girl, identified only as Jane Doe, was 14 at the time. She was the youngest of sev- eral alleged victims of Epstein, according to Palm Beach police, who spent 11 months investigating him. The federal lawsuit, filed by Miami at- • torney Jeffrey Herman, says "Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for under- age minor girls." Epstein "gained access to primarily disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money." • Herman, who specializes

"Jane Doe ... fell into Epstein's trap and • became one of his victims," the lawsuit says. "We're dismayed by the filing of the law- suit, but not surprised," said Jack Goldberger, stone of Epsteist's attorneys. "We think this shows what this case is all about: money." He and another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann Sanchez, launched an immediate counterof- fensive, even showing up at Herman's news conference outside the federal courthouse in West Palm Beach. The

"Jeffrey Epstein did not have sex with this woman," Sanchez said. Herman suggested that Epstein masturbated in front of the alleged victim and used a vibrator on her after she was brought to his home in February 2005. The girl is now 17. "This was a typical 14- year-old girl at the time she met Epstein," Herman said. 'What happened here was despicable." The girl told police inves- tigators that she informed Epstein she was 18 when she met him, and she said that was her age on her Web page, Sanchez said. The girl's fath

But Harvard University law Professor Alan Dershowitz, another Epstein attorney, pro- vided the state attorney's of- fice with information gleaned from the myspace.com Web site two years ago showing that some of Epstein's alleged victims boasted of their alco- hol and marijuana use. Herman said the girls' backgrounds aren't relevant to Epstein's purported be- havior. "They don't have the mental capacity to consent to something like this with a grown man." he said.

Herman subsequently withdrew the first Jane Doe's lawsuit because of squabbling by her parents over the litiga- tion. The girl may refile the suit after she turns 18 in May and can make her own deci- sions, Herman said. Other alleged victims also have contacted him, Herman said. "I do anticipate more cases," he said. In the latest litigation, Jane Doe No. 3 alleges that she was recruited lege student, to give Epstein a massage or money at his waterfront home late in 2004 or early in 2005.
