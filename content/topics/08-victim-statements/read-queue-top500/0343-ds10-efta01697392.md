Peters ed., US Department of Justice, USA Book By Kenneth V.tanning (Retired FBI Agent) Fredericksburg, VA 4.1 Introduction Caution: This chapter witfocus on insight into the behavioral patterns of offenders and victims in sexual exploitation of children cases involving computers. The information and its application are based on my education, training, and more than 27 years of experience studying the criminal aspects of deviant sexual behavior and interacting with investigators and prosecutors. Although I have great confidence in its behavioral accuracy and reliability, its legal acceptance and applicatio

The use of terms in this chapter which are also utilized in the mental health field (i.e., impulsive, compulsive, pedopbilia) is not meant to imply a psychiatric diagnosis or lack of legal responsibility. The sexual victimization of children involves varied and diverse dynamics. It can range from one-on-one intrafamilial abuse to multioffender/multivictim extrafamilial sex rings and from stranger abduction of toddlers to,prosfitution of teenagers. 4.6 Paraphilias and Sexual Ritual Behavior • Paraphilias are psychosexual disorders defined for clinical and research purposes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Ma

   > offenders. Understanding sexual ritual is the key to investigating certain sex offenders. The courts in this country have, however, been slow to recognize and understand the difference between MO and ritual. 4.7 The Distinction between a "Pedophile" and a Child Molester The general public, the media, and many child abuse professionals sometimes simplistically refer to all those who sexually victimize children as pedophiles. There is no single or uniform definition for the word "pedophile." As previously stated, for mental health professionals, it is a diagnostic term referring to persons with recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, urge; or behaviors involving prepubescent children. Technically, Pedophilia is a psychiatric diagnosis that can only be made by qualified psychologi

   > n who prefers to have sex with an adult partner may, for any number of reasons, 3 EFTA01697394 decide to have sex with a child. Such reasons might include simple availability, curiosity, or a desire to hurt a loved one of the molested child. The sexual fantasies of such individuals do not necessarily focus on children, and these people are not pedophiles. Are child molesters with adolescent victims pedophiles? Are individuals who collect both child' and adult pornography pedophiles? Is everyone using a computer to facilitate having sex with children, or trafficking in child pornography, a pedophile? Many child molesters are, in fact, pedophiles, and many pedophiles are child molesters. But they are not necessarily one and the same. Labeling all child molesters as pedophiles can be confu

   > recommend that investigators and prosecutors minimize the use of the term "pedophile." For the purposes of this discussion, the term "pedophile" when used will be defined as a significantly older individual who, prefers to have sex with individuals legally considered children. Pedophiles are individuals whose erotic imagery and sexual fantasies focus on children. They do not settle for child victims, but, in fact, prefer to have sex with children. The law, not puberty, determines who is a child. A pedophile is just one example or subcategory of what I refer to as a "preferential sex offender." The term preferential sex offender is merely a descriptive label used only to identify, for investigative and prosecutive purposes, a certain type of offender. The term does not appear in the DSM-

If they collect pornography, it is often violent in nature, reflecting their power and anger needs. Their patterns of behavior are more likely to involve the previously discussed concept of Method of Operation (MO). Situational type sex offenders victimizing children do not have a true sexual preference for ' children. They may molest them, however, for a wide variety of situational reasons. They are more likely to view and be aroused by adult pornography, but might engage in sex with children in certain situations. Situational sex offenders frequently molest readily available children that they have easy access to, such as their own or thos

   > e of the purposes of this typology is to avoid these diagnostic terms. Preferential type sex offenders are more likely to view, be aroused by, and collect theme pornography. Some preferential sex offenders without a preference for children do molest children in order to carry out their bizarre sexual fantasies and preferences with young, less threatening, less judgmental, and highly vulnerable victims. Some of these offenders' sexual activity with children may involve acts they are embarrassed or ashamed to request or do with a preferred adult partner. Such offenders, even if they do not have a sexual preference for children, would still be preferential sex offenders and therefore engage in similar patterns of behavior. There are many advantages to the use of this criminal justice, descri

There is no legal requirement to determine that a subject or suspect in a case is a pedophile or preferential sex offender. Often it is irrelevant to the investigation or prosecution. There are, however, clear differences betWeen the types of individuals who sexually victimize children, and prosecutors handling these cases sometimes need to make such distinctions. Although there is not a "profile" that will determine if someone is a child molester, preferential sex offenders tend to engage in highly predictable and recognizable behavior patterns.

For example, the pornography and erotica collection of the diverse preferential offender will be more varied, usually with a focus on their particular sexual preferences or paraphilias (sometimes involving children), whereas a pedophile's collection will focus predominately on children (sometimes involving paraphilias). If children are being victimized, the diverse offender is more likely to directly molest pubescent children. More naive prepubescent children, however, are sometimes selected to minimize confronting possible challenges to, or embarrassment over, their deviant sexual interests. With an absence of prior criminal sexual activity, latent offenders present problems concerning what prosecution and sentence is appropriate. A t

   > sex chat rooms. Paraphilias are psychosexual disorders and not types of sex crimes. They may or may not involve criminal activity. Individuals suffering from one or more of these paraphilias can just engage in fantasy and masturbate, or they can act out their fantasies legally (e.g., consenting adult partners, ' objects), or they can act out their fantasies illegally nonconsenting partners, underage partners). It is their choice. Although any of the paraphilias could become elements of a computer child sexual exploitation case,'Pedophilia is the most obvious and the one best known to prosecutors dealing with these cases. It is important for prosecutors to understand that the diagnostic criteria for Pedophilia require that there be recurrent, intense, and sexually arousing fantasies, urg
