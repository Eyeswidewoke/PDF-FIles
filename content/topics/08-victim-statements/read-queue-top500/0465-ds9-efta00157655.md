   > y Section ("CEOS") regarding the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida ("USAO").' I will refrain from recounting Mr. Epstein's arguments in detail here, but, rather, will highlight salient points responsive to the CEOS letter. In particular, I write from a background well familiar with child exploitation cases and victim/witness issues. As the CEOS letter points out (CEOS letter at p. 3), I was a member of CEOS. In fact, I served as a federal prosecutor for twelve years; five years as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, and seven years at CEOS. I began working as a trial attorney for CEOS in 1999, and was promoted to Deputy Chief for Litigation in 2002, and ultimate

I began working as a trial attorney for CEOS in 1999, and was promoted to Deputy Chief for Litigation in 2002, and ultimately to Principal Deputy Chief for the Section in 2004. As those who have worked with me know, I have a history of working diligently on behalf of victims of crime. While at the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of West Virginia, I was a part of the prosecution team that prosecuted the first case in the country under the federal Violence Against Women Act. United States v. Bailey, 112 F.3d 758 (4th Cir.), cert denied, 522 U.S. 896 (1997). The case went to trial and the defendant was sentenced to life in prison. I also s

Later, while at the Department of Justice, I co-authored the Department's Federal Child Support Prosecution Handbook. My work at CEOS permitted me to continue my efforts on behalf of vulnerable victims of crime. While there, for example, I was part of the prosecution team in United States v. Dwight York, 428 F.3d 1325 (I I th Cir. 2005), cert denied, 548 U.S. 908 (2006). York was the leader of a pseudo religious organization, and systematically molested countless children, some as young as six years old. The case went to trial and York was sentenced to 135 years in prison. As part of that

   > d. The case went to trial and York was sentenced to 135 years in prison. As part of that trial team, I was awarded the Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service. Additionally, at CEOS I was one of the architects of the Innocence Lost Initiative, a nationwide initiative designed to combat child prostitution. For this, I was awarded an Assistant Attorney General's Award for Outstanding Victim/Witness Service. Likewise, I was awarded a subsequent Assistant Attorney General's Award for Special Initiative in connection with a nationwide sex tourism prosecution initiative I helped to develop. I say all this not for any boastful purpose, but, rather, to make clear that I am fully cognizant of victim issues, and that 1 am no pushover in terms of prosecution standards. I am also very wel

I say all this not for any boastful purpose, but, rather, to make clear that I am fully cognizant of victim issues, and that 1 am no pushover in terms of prosecution standards. I am also very well aware of the good work of CEOS, and the outstanding credentials of those who toil in that office. With all due respect to CEOS, however (and recognizing that their review of this case was quite limited), given the facts and circumstances of this investigation, a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein simply s

To the extent prohibited sexual activity occurred, any inducement, enticement, and/or persuasion used would have taken place during a face-to-face encounter—thus eliminating the possibility for the commission of a federal crime, which requires the existence of a communication through a facility of interstate commerce in which the defendant persuades or entices the minor to engage in illegal sexual activity. Furthermore, any prohibited sexual activity that did occur based on the facts on the record is best left to the state to address because the facts of this case do not fall comfortably within the federal domain. This is a case about purely local activity, involving local actors, and affecting local interests and thus, should be handled by local authoritie

   > (CEOS letter at p. 4), the fact is this case does not look awaking like those cases. The facts here do not carry any of the hallmarks that typify an appropriate federal prosecution for child exploitation as reflected in all such prior federal prosecutions. Specifically, the facts here do not can' the hallmarks for a sex trafficking or child prostitution prosecution. Mr. Epstein did not target minors. In fact, the evidence indicates just the opposite. There was no travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity. There was no prohibited use of a facility of interstate commerce. There was no commercial for profit sexual enterprise. There was no force. There was no violence. There was no use of drugs or alcohol. There was no child pornography. 18 U.S.C.

Indeed, Mr. Epstein took several steps to ensure that no minors entered his home most notably, by affirmatively asking the women whether they were actually 18. age., . At 38-39. That fact — which many of the potential witnesses have confirmed in sworn interviews — strongly indicates that Mr. Epstein specifically intended to preclude an ne under 18 from giving him a massage. That fact is confirmed by, among other things, testimony that "he likes the gir

CEOS seeks to buttress the USAO prosecution by asserting "it is possible to satisfy that element [proof of specific intent as to the age of the alleged victims] with proof that the defendant was deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest that the person was a minor." (CEOS letter at p. 2). Such assertion is counter to the law and to the facts. Reliance on a deliberate ignorance standard as to any of the three statutes in issue requires the factual predicate of an intent not to learn of an incriminating fact. This is the antithesis of the factual context of this case where there is repeated proof that the minors believed that they had to lie because Mr.

Reliance on a deliberate ignorance standard as to any of the three statutes in issue requires the factual predicate of an intent not to learn of an incriminating fact. This is the antithesis of the factual context of this case where there is repeated proof that the minors believed that they had to lie because Mr. Epstein had an actual practice of attempting to verify age, and would not let them in his house if they were under the age of 18. See United States v. Kennard, 472 F.3d 851, 857-858 (1 3'Cir. 2006), quoting, United States v Puche, 350 F.3d t 137, 1149 (11th Cir. 2003) (An instruction on deliberate ignorance is appropriate only if it is shown [among o

   > allegations against Mr. Epstein to be that Mr. Epstein paid individuals to find friends and acquaintances, certain of whom were under the age of IS, to provide topless massages to him at his Palm Beach home in exchange for money. Mr. Epstein's assistants allegedly scheduled these massages for him over the telephone at the direction of Mr. Epstein, allegedly including some scheduling calls to underage women. However, the evidence contradicts these allegations. First, Mr. Epstein did not ask that the masseuses be under the age of 18. To the contrary, he specifically asked that they be 18 or older. As one witness commented, "Maid tell 3505-019 Page 8 of 63 SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17 EFTA_00003280 EFTA00157662 ALLEN GUTHRIE MaHIGH & THOMAS, PLLC Mr.

Second, Mr. Epstein himself did not schedule such appointments. Third, Mr. Epstein would not know who would be providing a massage at any particular time. Fourth, and importantly, Mr. Epstein's assistants were not directed to contact underage women, and were not aware of the true ages of the women they contacted. In fact, more often than not, the masseuses themselves, or the individuals who introduced the masseuses, made the initial contact. As a result, Mr. Epstein and his assistants were routinely unaware of the identities of many of these young women before they arrived. The allegations further include the assertion that Mr. E

As a result, Mr. Epstein and his assistants were routinely unaware of the identities of many of these young women before they arrived. The allegations further include the assertion that Mr. Epstein engaged in unlawful sexual conduct with certain underage women who arrived at his house to provide a massage. At times, during these massages, Mr. Epstein masturbated, engaged in some sexual touching, and a small number of alleged acts of penetration. However, most of the women who perfonned massages on Mr. Epstein were over the age of 18. Many of the young women have sworn under oath that they, in fact, told Mr. Epstein that they were 18 or older,

In fact, Mr. Epstein has passed a polygra h examination to this effect relative to the government's primary, and youngest, alleged victim, Indeed, many of the women also worked at local massage parlors, which presumably had a requirement that the masseuse have reached the age of majority. To the extent there are allegations that Mr. Epstein should have been alerted to certain underage women based on conversations he allegedly had with them, those conversations would have taken place in person and at his home, thereby precluding any prior scheduling with knowledge of their true ages. As explained below, any factual allegations of repeat massages with such persons would lack necessary elements required for a federal nexus to such conduct. All of the alleged activity occurre

All of the alleged activity occurred in Mr. Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida. Manyof the massages allegedly involved conduct which, even if engaged in, is not proscribed by federal law, either because the masseuses were of age, or because conduct with underage masseuses only involved topless massages, massages in undergarments or naked massages. To the extent prohibited sexual activity occurred, any inducement, enticement, and/or persuasion used would have taken place during a face-to-face encounter—thus eliminating the possibility for the commission of a federal crime, which requires the existence of a communication through a facility of interstat
