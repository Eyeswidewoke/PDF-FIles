Mr. Lanier said Mr. Epstein had once hypothesized that atoms behaved like investors in a marketplace. Mr. Lanier said he had declined any funding from Mr. Epstein and that he had met with him only once after Mr. Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor. Mr. Epstein was willing to finance research that others viewed as bizarre. He told one scientist that he was bankrolling efforts to identify a mysterious particle that might trigger the feeling that someone is watching you.

Prosecutor asked for a June 2020 trial date to be set, telling the judge: "We don't think that any delay in this case is in the public interest." The Manhattan US attorney's office alleged earlier in July that Epstein "sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls" from 2002 to 2005. Some of his victims were just 14 years old, prosecutors alleged. The disgraced financier, who was arrested on 6 July, pleaded not guilty several weeks ago.

Rather than face federal charges that could have put him away for life, Epstein pleaded guilty in state court to minor prostitution charges and served just a year in the county stockade — which permitted him to leave the lockup for his luxurious downtown West Palm Beach office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. This "work release" arrangement, highly unusual for a sex offender, is now under criminal investigation by order of the Palm Beach sheriff, Ric Bradshaw, who oversees the stockade and approved the wor

Epstein Lawyers Ask for a Year to Review a Million Pages Bloomberg By Chris Dolmetsch , Bob Van Voris , and Patricia Hurtado 7/31/19 Jeffrey Epstein's lawyers say they need at least a year to review a blizzard of documents prosecutors have gathered against the fund manager as they prepare to defend him against charges of sex trafficking in minors and conspiracy. Prosecutors asked a judge to schedule Epstein's trial for next June, but defense attorney Martin Weinberg said his team wanted to wait until September 2020, because they haven't yet begun to receive documents from the government. "We need time to receive a million pages of discovery and prepare to defend a four- to six-week trial," Weinberg said during a brief hearing in Ma

Weinberg declined to answer questions about the incident outside court. Epstein, who wore dark blue jail scrubs over a brown T-shirt, didn't speak during the hearing. He's pleaded not guilty to accusations he sexually abused dozens of underage girls - some as young as 14 — in his Upper East Side townhouse and his waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, between 2002 and 2005. Berman set a Sept. 13 deadline for defense motions in the case, and Weinberg said he planned to seek dismissal of a conspiracy charge on grounds of double jeopardy tied to allegations that underpinned a non-prosecution agreement that Epstein struck in 2008 w

The non-prosecution deal was reached before he pleaded guilty in state court in Florida to prostitution-related charges involving underage girls. Afterward, he was required to register as a sex offender and pay restitution to many victims. While he served a 13-month jail term, he was permitted to leave jail to work for 12 hours a day, six days a week.

Epstein, a financier who owns homes around the world, including a waterfront estate in Palm Beach, was arrested July 6, nearly eight months after the Miami Herald published Perversion of Justice, a two-year investigation of a much-reviled secret plea deal in 2007-2008 that spared Epstein a sweeping federal indictment despite allegations of sexual abuse by nearly three dozen underage girls. He had just arrived from France at New Jersey's Teterboro airport on his private jet when authorities met him and took him into custody. During the early- and mid-2000s, Epstein allegedly ran what amounted to a sexual pyramid scheme, using recruiters to lure girls as young as 14 to his lavish Palm Beach and Manhattan mansions with the promise that they would receive $200 to give a man

At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors sought a June 2020 trial date, while a lawyer for Epstein asked that it wait another three months. The lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said Epstein and his legal team needed more time to review evidence, expected to total more than 1 million pages.
