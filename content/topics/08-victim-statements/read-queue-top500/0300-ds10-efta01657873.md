The Court is at a total loss as to why the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, as well as the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold the following information from the Court.

At this point being fully informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding Defendant's crime, the Court imposed a sentence above the advisory guideline range. Specifically, the Court sentenced Defendant to a term of imprisonment of 120 months, to be followed by a term of supervisi

   > sentence above the advisory guideline range was necessary to afford an adequate deterrence to criminal conduct. The Court notes that, like so many sexual crimes committed today, the charge to which Defendant pled guilty had its origin in use of the internet. The Court notes that "cyberspace provides an increasingly common and effective medium by which would-be sexual predators can contact minors." United States v. Robertson, 350 F.3d 1109, 1113 (10th Cir. 2003). As Defense counsel stated to the Court at sentencing, the internet allows socially immature or insecure people to interact with others at a level of intimacy that would have been impossible prior to its widespread employment. See DE 57, p. 17. 11 EFTA01657883 Case 9:06-cr-80058-WJZ Document 60 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/16

The Court notes, however, that the widespread use of the internet to engage minors, as well as the "opportunity," id., it provides to immature or reclusive individuals who would engage in such conduct to ultimately criminal ends, calls for heavier sentences providing greater deterrence, not lighter sentences providing judicial imprimatur to conduct the representatives of the people have continuously attempted to prohibit and discourage.

First, before Defendant came to Florida, C's father reminded Defendant that she was underage, and told Defendant to stay away from her. While 3553(a) does not require that the Court impose sentence as to promote respect for parental directives, the Court notes that Defendant's disregard of this particular directive factors into the imposition of Defendant's sentence because the statement of C's father accurately reflects the law of the land. Defendant was provided a warning of the

Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 856 (1992) ("[F]or two decades of economic and social development, people have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail."). Defendant, and the underage girls with whom he developed the relationships described above, have lived their entire lives after the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and the conduct described in this Order exposes a facet of the dark underbelly of conducting social development, and organizing intimate relationships, based on the availability of abortion. 14 EFTA01657886 Case 9:06-cr-8005
