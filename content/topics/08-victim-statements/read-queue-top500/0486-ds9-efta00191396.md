Dershowitz moves to intervene to strike a proffer made by Jane Doe No. 3 of facts that support her pending motion to join this action. The Court should deny the motion. Dershowitz has not established any direct interest in this Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) action that would entitle him to intervene as of right under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). Nor has he met Rule 24(b)'s standards for discretionary intervention for four reasons: First, Dershowitz has another forum in which to litigate and defend his reputational interests — a pending defamation action regarding this very case; second, Dershowitz (and other persons Jane Doe No. 3

See 18 U.S.C. 3771(e) ("For the purposes of this chapter, the term 'crime victim' means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of federal offense . . . ."). With regard to Jane Doe No. 3, the motion indicated that when she was a minor, Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to Dershowitz and Prince Andrew (among others) for sexual purposes. Jane Doe No. 3 stated that she was prepared to prove her proffer. See DE 280 at 3 ("If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe No. 3 would prove the following . . . . "). The motion also provided specific reasons why Jane Doe No. 3's participation was relevant to the case, including the pendi

Two weeks ago, after Jane Doe No. 3 and Jane Doe No. 4 moved to join in this action, a spokesperson for Prince Andrew denied Jane Doe No. 3's allegations, without providing any explanation of what the Prince was doing with this minor girl late at night in a private setting. Accordingly, on January 14, 2015, Jack Scarola sent Prince Andrew a certified letter requesting his voluntary cooperation in answering questions about his sexual interactions with Jane Doe No. 16 EFTA00191418 3. See Exhibit 17. The letter requested an opportunity to take a statement under oath from Prince Andrew. Federal Express has informed us that

The fact that an important attorney on the defense team had strong personal reasons for resolving the case without a public trial bears directly on this question, by showing motivation to reach a secret deal. Dershowitz's need to keep his abuse secret, and his direct personal knowledge of Epstein's abuse, also

Her factual allegations — including the specific identities of those powerful persons - are clearly relevant to demonstrating the factual underpinnings for her estoppel argument. " In paragraph 52 of Exhibit 1, the name of a sexual participant and eye-witness was redacted out of an abundance of caution, because while she was not a minor at the relevant time she is believed to have 26 EFTA00191428 attorneys proffered in her earlier motion — i.e., that Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe No. 3 to numerous persons, including Dershowitz.

Because Dershowitz has not availed himself of any of those prior opportunities, the Court should deny his motion to intervene now. 2009 12 EFTA00191414 On about September 17, 2009, one of undersigned counsel (Brad Edwards) arranged to have Dershowitz served with a subpoena for deposition in connection with a civil case brought by one of the underage females who had sued Epstein (Doe 'Epstein, No. 9:08-cv-80893-KAM (S.D. Fla.)). At that point, Dershowitz understood that counsel for many of Epstein's victims believed that mounting evidence pointed toward his role extending beyond merely being an attorney for Epstein. That deposition ultimately did not occur, and Dershowitz made no effort to provide information about his knowledge of releva

On August 23, 2011, Scarola sent a letter to Dershowitz, explaining that there was no intent to inquire about attorney-client information, but adding: "[wje do, however, have reason to believe that you have personally observed Jeffrey Epstein in the presence of underage females, and we would like the opportunity to question you under oath about these observations." See Exhibit 13. Dershowitz declined to cooperate, so on September 7, 2011, Scarola again sent a letter to Dershowitz, noting that while there was "no obligation" to disclose the basis for wanting a deposition, the reason was that "[m]ultiple individuals have placed you in the presence of Jeffrey

As I am sure you will recall, our efforts to arrange such a deposition previously were unsuccessful, so we welcome your change of heart.

For example, the victims believe that among the 14,825 pages of discovery currently before the Court in camera are many documents proving the Government's had knowledge while it was negotiating the NPA that Epstein was trafficking underage girls for sex to Dershowitz and others. Indeed, it is likely that documents pertaining to the trafficking of Jane Doe No. 3 herself are found in those pages, and she would ask the Court to pay particular attention to such documents as part of its in camera review. This evidence provides a further reason the Government wanted to conceal the NPA from the victims — and the public: to avoid the o
