A Level 3 status means "high risk of repeat offense and a threat to public safety exists," according to the state's guidelines. Even though Epstein pleaded guilty to one count of sex crimes involving a minor girl in Palm Beach and one count of solicitation, there is plenty of evidence there were many more victims, according to the four-page ruling. Epstein's criminal convictions -- for which he served 13 months of an 18- month sentence with liberal work release hours -- requires him to register as a sex offender in every state where he owns a home.

Yet, the New York State Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders recommended Epstein be designated a Level 3. Gaffney said she was unable to rely on the Palm Beach Police's probable EFTA01482075 cause affidavit -- which listed multiple victims and multiple charges -- since the state attorney went forward on only one count of soliciting a minor. Gaffney said the victims, although they spoke to police early on, did not cooperate. Judge Ruth Pickholz would have none of it.

After serving 18 months in jail, he will be under house arrest for a year. And he will have a lifelong obligation to register as a sex offender. He must submit to an HIV test within 48 hours, with the results being provided to his victims or their parents. As part of the plea deal, federal investigators agreed to drop their investigation of Epstein, which they had taken to a grand jury, two law enforcement sources said. Epstein was indicted two years ago after an 11-month investigation by Palm Beach police. They received a complaint from a relative of a 14-year-old girl who had given Epstein a naked massage at his five-bed

At least one woman has sued him in New York, where he owns a 51,000square-foot Manhattan mansion. "It's validation of what we're saying in the civil cases," said Miami attorney Jeffrey Herman, who represents the alleged victims in the federal lawsuits. West Palm Beach attorney Ted Leopold represents one alleged victim in a civil suit in state court. He said he anticipates amending that lawsuit to add "a few other clients" as well.

He then asked for and got a federal investigation. Epstein hired a phalanx of high-priced lawyers - including Harvard law professor and author Alan Dershowitz - and public relations people who questioned Reiter's competence and the victims' truthfulness. In addition to mansions in Palm Beach and Manhattan, Epstein owns homes in New Mexico and the Virgin Islands. He's a frequent contributor to Democratic Party candidates. He also donated $30 million to Harvard in 2003. Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer returned a $50,000 campaign contribution from Epstein after his indictment, then resigned this year during his own sex sca

There was probable cause to charge Epstein with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious molestation, police concluded. The state attorney's office said questions about the girls' credibility led it to take the unprecedented step of presenting the evidence against Epstein to a grand jury, rather than directly charging him.

The indictment charged Epstein only with felony solicitation of prostitution. The state attorney's office later added the charge of procuring underage girls for that purpose. Prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek said of the plea: "I took into consideration the length the trial would have been and witnesses having to testify" about sometimes embarrassing incidents. Epstein may have made a serious mistake soon after he was charged. He rejected an offer to plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony, according to p
