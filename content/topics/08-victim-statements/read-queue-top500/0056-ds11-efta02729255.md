The parallel stay provision in § 1595, discussed supra at 8-9, mandates, without exception, that any civil action brought under that section for violation of § 1591 (prohibiting transportation of minors for prostitution) "shall be stayed during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in which the claimant is the victim." 18 U.S.C. § 1591(bX1). Whether the § 1595 plaintiff has turned 18 does not vitiate the efficacy of this mandatory stay. An example illustrates why the stay provided in § 3509(k) has the same broad scope as the stay provided in § 1591(bX1). As

An example illustrates why the stay provided in § 3509(k) has the same broad scope as the stay provided in § 1591(bX1). As discussed above, § 3509(k) stays any civil suit for injury to a minor, arising out of the same occurrence as a pending criminal action. One type of civil suit falling within § 3509(k)'s ambit is a suit seeking redress for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Section 2423(a) - - just like § 1591 - - prohibits transportation of minors for prostitution. The elements of both statutes are identical.

Thus, just as Congress mandated under § 1595(bX1) that civil discovery shall be stayed when there is an ongoing federal investigation under § 1591 (even after the victim turns 18), the identi
