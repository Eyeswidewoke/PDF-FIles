At my son's wedding eight to ten years ago, she really hung around him, and if anyone else was trying to talk to Bruce, she would try and get his attention. She would move in. From what I have observed, money appears to be the motivator.- McMahan makes that allegation in his lawsuit against Linda and Schutt, claiming that he was the victim of an extortion scheme. But he apparently never made a formal complaint to law enforcement about the conspiracy against him. One of his attorneys, Angela Agrusa, says that a San Diego prosecutor considered the extortion allegations while investigating charges that Schutt had hit Linda during a July 2005 argument over who owned the computers containing the e-mails and photos detailing Linda an

And she es- coned the girls upstairs when they arrived, putting fresh sheets on a massage table and placing massage oils nearby. • Police took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses.

And it increases the difficulty of prosecuting child sex abuse cases, especially when the defendant is enormously wealthy and can hire high- priced, top-tier lawyers. At least one of Epstein's alleged victims told police he knew she was underage when the two of them got naked for massages and sex- ual activity. She was 16 years old at the time and said Ep- stein asked her questions about her high school, ac- cording to police reports.

Epstein's youngest al- leged victim was 14 when she says she gave him a massage that included some sexual activity. She is now 16. The girl's father says he doesn't know whether she told Ep- stein her age. "My daughter has kept a lot of what happened from me because of sheer embarrass- ment," he said.

Likewise if the accused has a track record of sex with mi- nors. Still there is a "universal constant" in prosecuting these cases, Dekle said. Men who exploit underage chil- dren for sex often carefully choose their victims in ways that will minimize the risk to them, he said. Victims usually are from a lower social status, and they may suffer from psychologi- cal problems, Dekle said. "Lots of child sexual abuse victims have been vic- timized by multiple people over a period of time. Then the act of abuse produces behavior in the victims that further damages their credi- bility."

Epstein's defense seems to be that he didn't know the girls were minors, and that he is "very passionate about massage," as one of his lawyers says. littp://www.printthis.clickability.corn/ptkpt?action=cptectitle=Billionaires+Are+Free+-+T... 4/25/2007 EFTA01713392 • Billionaires Are Free - The Money Guide -- New York Magazine Page 3 of 5 Those who know Epstein say he's unfazed by his travails.

Ewell tells New Times that one of those men was billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who has been much in the news lately for allegedly hiring underaged women to strip topless and massage him at his Palm Beach mansion. At the time, in the early 1980s, McMahan and Epstein worked together at Bear Stearns in New York. Epstein didn't return a request for comment. "Jeffrey Epstein worked with [McMahan].
