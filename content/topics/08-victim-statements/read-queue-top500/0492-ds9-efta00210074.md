## Context Excerpts

   > h any individual woman. As the statute makes clear, the essence of this crime is the communication itself—not the resulting act. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in Murrell, underscores the point: The defendant in Bailey contended that attempt under § 2422(b) `requires the specific intent to commit illegal sexual acts rather than just the intent to persuade or solicit the minor victim to commit sexual acts.' Id. at 638. In response, the court held `[w]hile it may be rare for there to be a separation between the intent to persuade and the follow-up intent to perform the act after persuasion, they are two clearly separate and different intents and the Congress has made a clear choice to criminalize persuasion and the attempt to persuade, not the performance of the sexual ac

   > uspected or should have known whether a particular person was or was not over age. The history of cases brought under this statute make crystal clear that knowledge of the defendant regarding the age of the women is required—either by admission or by incontrovertible transcripts of conversations (i.e. stings operations which require repeated acknowledgment of the defendant's awareness of the victims' age). Even states with absolute liability about mistake regarding age rarely prosecute cases where definitive proof is lacking (Palm Beach County rarely does and when it does, it imposes house arrest sentences). This is a matter for the exercise of state prosecutorial discretion and not federal mandatory minimum statutes that were not intended to cover such conduct. A third essential eleme

   > ch any person can be charged" necessarily excludes acts as to which the state's statute of limitations has run. Under Florida law, prostitution and prostitution-related offenses are misdemeanors in the second degree for a first violation.2 See Fla. Stat.. § 796.07(4)(a). The limitations period for a misdemeanor in the second degree is one year, and there is no tolling provision based upon the victim's age. See Fla. Stat. § 775.15(6). Even as to allegations of third degree felonies, the statute of limitations is three years. Thus, any conduct alleged to have occurred before mid-June 2005 cannot be charged as a matter of state law and thus cannot be a predicate for a § 2422(b) offense—even if the federal statute of limitations has not run on any given § 2422(b) offense because of the leng

   > declining to bring charges in cases far more egregious than this one. To take just one obvious example, federal prosecutors have self- consciously refrained from involvement in the literally dozens of sexual cases of former priests, opting instead to allow seasoned state prosecutors (like the ones in this case) to pursue the accused former clergymen. That is so despite (1) the large number of victims, (2) the vast geographic diversity of the cases, and (3) the fact that some of these cases involve allegations that the defendant forcibly molested, abused, or raped literally dozens of children—including some as young as five years old—over a period of years. Nonetheless, federal prosecutors have not hesitated to let their state counterparts pursue these cases free from federal interference

   > testimony taken to date categorically confirms that (i) Mr. Epstein did not target minors; (ii) women under 18 often lied to Mr. Epstein about their ages; (iii) Mr. Epstein did not travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity; (iv) Mr. Epstein did not use the Internet, telephone or any other means of interstate communication to coerce or entice alleged victims; (v) Mr. Epstein did not apply force or coercion to obtain sexual favors; and (vi) all sexual activity that occurred was unplanned and purely consensual. The women's own statements—made under oath—demonstrate the absence of a legitimate federal concern in this matter, and highlight the serious practical difficulties an attempted federal prosecution would face. • Mr. Epstein did not recruit

   > ty) rather than the broader construction (which expands the federal prosecutor's arsenal) controls under the venerable rule of lenity. Mr. Epstein's conduct—including his misconduct—falls within the heartland of historic state police and prosecutorial powers. Absent a significant federal nexus, matters involving prostitution have always been treated as state-law crimes even when they involve minors. Mr. Epstein's conduct lacks any of the hallmarks that would convert this quintessential state crime into a federal one under any of the statutes prosecutors are considering. Mr. Epstein lived in Palm Beach, and his interstate travel was merely to go home. My sexual conduct that occurred after he arrived was incidental to the purposes for his travel. Even CEOS admitted that applying § 2423(

   > r, Mr. Epstein did not use the intemet (either via email or chatrooms) to communicate with any of the witnesses in this investigation. Indeed, he did not use any other facility of interstate commerce, including the phone, to knowingly persuade, entice, or induce anyone to visit his home—the "local" locus of all the incidents under investigation—much less to persuade, entice, or induce a known minor to engage in prohibited sex acts, as § 2422(b) requires. Nor did anyone on his behalf "persuade" or "induce" or "entice" or "coerce" anyone as these words are ordinarily understood and as the new Supreme Court decisions mandate they be applied: narrowly, without stretching ordinary usage to conform to a prosecutor's case-specific need for a broad (and in this case unprecedented) application.

   > ned several times. The State Attorney's Office (the "SAO") has vast experience prosecuting sex crimes and conducted an exhaustive, 15-month investigation of Mr. Epstein. A Grand Jury has concluded that Mr. Epstein was merely a local "John," guilty of soliciting prostitution in violation of state law. Notably, Florida law distinguishes soliciting from procuring and compelling prostitution if minors are involved. Indeed, soliciting is a misdemeanor except for the commission of a third subsequent offense, turning it into a felony. The SAO, therefore, sought and obtained an indictment charging Mr. Epstein with felony solicitation of prostitution. Mr. Epstein is prepared to plead guilty and accept a sentence for that offense—a sentence that, notably, is far more severe than that meted out

   > rted case under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b), and cannot find a single one that resulted in a conviction on facts akin to the ones here. In some respects, it is not surprising that no precedent supports federal prosecution of a man who engaged in consensual conduct, in his home, that amounts to solicitation under State law. After all, prostitution, even when the allegations involve minors, is fundamentally a State concern, United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, n.1 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that federal law "does not criminalize all acts of prostitution (a vice traditionally governed by state regulation)"), and there is no evidence that Palm Beach County authorities and Florida prosecutors cannot effectively prosecute and punish the conduct.

Mr. Epstein's conduct does not satisfy the elements of § 2422(b). Each element must be individually stretched, and then conflated in a tenuous chain to encompass the alleged conduct with any individual woman. As the statute makes clear, the essence of this crime is the communication itself—not the

The evidentiary pattern does not even establish willful blindness since Mr. Epstein took steps to ensure his visitors were over 18—and certainly took none to avoid knowing. But, even if the government contends that it possesses evidence that could demonstrate that Mr. Epstein knew or should have known or suspected that a small number of the masseuses were underage, that would still not make this an appropriate case for federal, rather than state prosecution. The federal statutes were not intended to supersede state prosecutions involving isolated instances of underage sex. Instead, the federal statutes were intended for large-scale rings or for an individual who was engaged, while using interstate facilities such as the Internet, with the willful tar

In stark contrast, there is no jurisdictional hook that brings Mr. Epstein's conduct within the ambit of the statute, and securing a prosecution on these facts would require a court to set aside both reason and precedent to convict a local `John' with a sex- slavery crime. It can not be said that Mr. Epstein engaged in trafficking and slavery nor did he knowingly recruit or obtain underage women with knowledge that they would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act. Thus, prosecuting him under this statute would expand the law far beyond its scope. To the extent there are cases where prosecutors think that Mr. Epstein should have known that certain women were underage, there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein "caused [them] to engage in a commercial sex act."
