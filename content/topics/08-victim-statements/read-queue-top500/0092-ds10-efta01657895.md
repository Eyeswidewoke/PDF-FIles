There has been some reference to another incident with a minor girl. What do you know about that, if anything? MS. VILLAFANA: Your Honor, there are two other minor girls that have been THE COURT: You mean in addition to the victim in this case? MS. VILLAFANA: Yes, your honor. THE COURT: Go ahead. MS. VILLAFANA: One was a girl who was 16 years old who met the Defendant via the internet when he was 19. She traveled at his request from California to Texas, and they did engage in a sexual relationship that resulted in her getting pregnant. There also was a 15 year old girl that the Defendant was developing a relation

At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel Hunt characterized Defendant as a shy young man, whose shyness was probably compounded by certain psychological difficulties. Hunt further characterized Defendant as a young man who simply fell in love with the victim in this case. See DE 57, pp. 18-19. During the sentencing Hunt argued that a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines was appropriate given the facts of the case. Counsel for the Government, in turn, focused on the fact that actual sexual conduct had occurred between Defendant and the victim, as opposed to a sting operation using a law enforcement agent posing as a minor, where no

Counsel for the Government, in turn, focused on the fact that actual sexual conduct had occurred between Defendant and the victim, as opposed to a sting operation using a law enforcement agent posing as a minor, where no actual sexual conduct takes place.

See id. pp. 29-32. The Government concluded that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range was appropriate. During the sentencing, the Court heard an impact statement from the victim's mother. She detailed the emotional and psychological damage done to her daughter by her involvement with Defendant. In the course of her statement, she referenced her belief that Defendant was a sexual predator based on his conduct with her daughter and another underage girl with whom he was 3 EFTA01657897 Case 9:06-cr-80058-WJZ Document 70 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/09/2007 Page 4 of 1

It was only when the Court inquired into Defendant's contact with the other minor referenced by the victim's mother that the full nature of Defendant's conduct became clear. The Court learned that Defendant's first relationship with a minor occurred when he was 19, and the minor was 16. They met over the internet, and she traveled from California to meet the Defendant and engage in a sexual relationship. She consequently became pregnant and thereafter had an abortion.

Second, the Government states that because Defendant's conduct with minors other than the victim in this case was not criminal, it was not relevant in the sense that it would not have affected his guideline range. The Court notes that Lourie raised both arguments at the hearing on this Motion and vigorously advocated the position that Defendant's sexual conduct with another minor was not relevant under Defendant's guideline computation and the factors enumerated under 18 U.S.C. § 3661

   > iscussed above, traveled from California to Texas where she and Defendant engaged in sexual intercourse. Under Texas law, Defendant could have been charged with Sexual Assault and Indecency With A Child, both separate offenses. Tex. Penal Code §§ 22.011(a)(2)(A), 22.11(a) (1) (Vernon 2007). Both statutes contain an affirmative defense if the actor is not more than three years older than the victim. Id. §§ 22.011(e)(1), 22.11(b) (1). While the record in this case is unclear as to whether Defendant could have availed himself of that defense, the fact remains that he could have been charged under the aforementioned provisions. This, in turn, means that Defendant could have been convicted of a federal offense under the Mann Act, 8 EFTA01657902 Case 9:06-cr-80058-WJZ Document 70 Enter

   > Court imposes sentencing. The relevancy of other behavior is particularly obvious in this action. At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel Hunt took great pains to paint Defendant as shy and immature for his age, as a psychologically troubled young man who could not communicate with girls his own age. Hunt further argued that Defendant took great pains to cultivate a relationship with the victim, and that they were very much in love. Hunt believed that these factors warranted a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines. While the Government took the position that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range was appropriate, there was nothing in Villafana's argument to the Court that factually contradicted the picture 11 EFTA01657905 Case 9:06-cr-80058-WJZ Document 70

The Order contains the following language, which forms the basis for the instant Motion: By the conclusion of allocution, the Court had become concerned with the passing references to sexual contact between Defendant and other minors made not only at sentencing, but elsewhere in the record. See, e.g., DE Nos. 26, p. 1, 30, p. 3, and 31, p. 9. The Court therefore inquired about the same, and includes the Government's response here in full, first, because it contributed significantly to the Court's reasoning in imposing sentence.
