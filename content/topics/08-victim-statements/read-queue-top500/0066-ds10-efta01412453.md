While the Palm Beach police said they believed they had sufficient evidence for Mr. Epstein to be charged with at least four counts of unlawful sex with minors, he was allowed to plead guilty to a single count of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Subsequently, lawyers for two other women -- including the woman who claimed to have had sex as a minor with Mr. Dershowitz and Prince Andrew -- filed a motion seeking to join the lawsuit.
