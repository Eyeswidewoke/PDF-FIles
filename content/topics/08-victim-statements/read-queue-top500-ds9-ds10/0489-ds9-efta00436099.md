As the pollee records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could "say no" at any time during a massage as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in every victim's statement: First she would be asked to remove her shin. then her pants. He would attempt to fondle her bullocks and breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator.

Epstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe st tp/iwww.thedailyb...obrefaobnetwort The Justice Department is investigating Jeffrey Epstein for child trafficking, The Daily Beast has learned—and has widened the scope of its probe to include a famous modeling agency. Hedge-find manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last week. But it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that: • Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein's activities, to see whether there is evidence of child trafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the arrangement between Epstein and the Department oflustice allowing him to plead guilty to lower-level

"I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 'offender: "the Wall Street hedge fund manager told The Post. "It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel." said Epstein. Well that's not exactly the correct analogy... Not only are Epstein's comments brazen, they are arrogant and self-implicating. By telling a reporter "Pm an offender", he seems to be admitting guilt.

Had Epstein been a caring benefactor contributing to society and these young girl's education and well being then the world would have judged him differently. What he has done instead is the exact opposite -- causing enormous damage to hundreds of underage girls who could have been sponsored towards a better education. With respect to Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance. I'm confused by his decision to allow this sexual predator to live at his Fifth Avenue house all this time (since August 2010), given his rather tough stance on gun control as witnessed by his testimony in Friday's NYPosr when asked about a Florida driver cleared in a Manhattan weapon's cha

A former bookkeeper in the Miami office. who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein's private jets. It's true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily several times—although, according to Florida statutes. none of that has any bearing on the criminality of the contact, particularly if the girt was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this case—judging by arrangements at the Palm Beach house—is that Epstein. a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organiz
