You shocked me with that position on November 21' and promised to get back to me to discuss it. Since we met in November, we haven't received a response regarding this issue.

Furthermore, nowhere in the Agreement or Addendum does it state that a fee dispute or contentions as to the exact role of the attorney representative constitute a breach of that Agreement. In fact, them is a requirement that fee disputes be resolved with a special master. As I further explain be
