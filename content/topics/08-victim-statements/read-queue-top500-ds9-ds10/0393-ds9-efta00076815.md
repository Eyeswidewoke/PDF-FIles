It sets forth a presumption in favor of remand, an exception to the pre- sumption in most cases which favors pre- trial release. § 3142 states that: "if there is probable cause to believe that the person committed ... an offense involving a mi- nor victim under section . . . 1591," then "it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of conditions will rea- sonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the community." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E) (emphasis added); see United States v. Martir 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 (2d Cir. 1986). The Indictment in this case was returned by a grand jury thus establishing probabl

In most federal cases the rebuttable presumption that applies favors pretrial release, not remand. [2] There is another very important issue to be considered in this case. It has to do with "victims" of the crimes charged in the Indictment. Victims refer to the "minor" girls who are alleged to have been sexually trafficked by the Defendant. Un- der 18 U.S.C. § 3771, victims are entitled to be heard in court, including on the question of whether the defendant is to be released or remanded. Victims have, EFTA00076818 310 425 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 3d SERIES among other things, been given the oppor- tunity to testify at the bail hearing. B. Counsels' Submis
