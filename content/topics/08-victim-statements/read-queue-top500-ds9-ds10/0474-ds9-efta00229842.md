   > BSAO indictment was reported in the papers, and additional girls identified through those interviews. I will first address the different crimes with which Epstein can be charged, setting forth the elements of those offenses and the types of evidence that I intend to use to satisfy those elements. Second, I will summarize the evidence related to each girl who has been identified as a potential victim in this case. As to each date/event identified, I will note which offense was committed and, if charged, the Count number related to that offense. Appendix A also contains a sheet for each girl, which contains a photograph taken around the time she met Epstein, her date of birth, and a summary of the evidence related to that girl. Appendix B is a chart summarizing the evidence pertaining to e

Third, Epstein transported in interstate commerce with the intent that engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2421. For these three offenses, knowledge of the victim's age does not need to be proven, although a reasonable belief that a person is over 18 is an affirmative defense to a limited portion of § 2423(6). F6 In those instances where Epstein and/or the assistants knew the ages of the girls (or had reason to know their ages but willfully blinded themselves to that knowledge), they can be char ed with sex traffickin , in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 159

The Mann Act criminalizes traveling in interstate commerce to engage in "illicit sexual conduct," (§ 2423(b)), using a facility of interstate commerce to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity or prostitution (§ 2422(b)), and transporting a person to engage in sexual activity (§ 2421). Sections 2423(6) and 2422(6) require a minor victim, but they do not require that the defendant know that the victim is a minor. For example, in December, the Fourth Circuit issued its opinion in United States v. Jones , 471 F.3d 535 (4th Cir. 2006).

Jones argued that the term "knowingly" in that section required the Government to prove that Jones knew the age of the victim. The Fourth Circuit soundly rejected the argument, citing the other circuits reaching the same conclusion. Jones , 471 F.3d at 538-39 (citing United States v. Griffith , 284 F.3d 338, 351 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Taylor , 239 F.3d 994, 997 (9th Cir. 2001); United States v. Scisum , 32 F.3d 1479, 1485-86 (10th Cir. 1994); United States v.

First, Epstein traveled in interstate commerce with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b). Second, Epstein and his assistants used a facility of interstate commerce to induce or entice minors to engage in prostitution and sexual activity for which EFTA00229843 any person can be charged, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b). Third, Epstein transported in interstate commerce with the intent that engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2421.

In conducting its analysis, the Jones Court relied upon cases interpreting sections of Title 21 relating to the distribution of drugs to a minor. See Jones at 540. Those cases have held that the Government must prove only that the defendant knowingly distributed the narcotics to someone who happened to be underage. While the Eleventh Circuit has not addressed the question posed by Jones , it has addressed 21 U.S.C. § 861(a)(3) and has reached the same conclusion in approving the district court's instructions to the jury: Section 845 of 21 U.S.C.A. provides that anyone who knowingly or intentionally distributes controlled substances to a person under twenty-one is subject to enhanced penalties. . . .

For girls who were 16 or 17 at the time, I have charged only travel to engage in a "commercial sex act." I also have elected to treat all of these sexual massages as "commercial sex acts" regardless of whether there was any penetration. Epstein exchanged money for the opportunity to view underage girls in various states of undress and to masturbate in front of them. As described by the girls, Epstein received sexual gratification from the experience and he constantly tried to "push the envelope" to convince the girls to become more and more sexual. As R. described, when a girl refused to let Epstein touch her, Epstein "down-promoted her" to become a recruiter. d. Conspiracy [Count 21

Once of job responsibilities, for which she was paid handsomely, was to arrange both the appointments with the underage girls and also to arrange Epstein's travel. Epstein's pilots testified that was the person who would call them to have them at the airport at ar en time and who would tell them where they would be traveling to. Accordingly, I have charged alone with a single count of violating § 2423(c). f. The Affirmative Defense Regarding Knowledge of Age Section 2423(g) provides that in "a prosecution u

Congress's decision to include an affirmative defense to part of the statute shows that it has considered the issue and determined that the Government does not have to prove that the defendant knew the victims were underage for the other portions of the statute. This is consistent with the cases interpreting various sections of the Mann Act. EFTA00229852 Thus, for those instances where we know that a 16- or 17-year-old girl affirmatively told Epstein that she was 18 — and it would have been reasonable for Epstein to believe that statement — I have not charged Epstein with violating 2423(b). g.

This charge has frequently been used in connection with "sex tourism" cases prosecuted by the Office, where the defendant arranged through an undercover "travel a enc " to travel overseas to have sex with underage prostitutes. This case is analogous with M, , and serving as Esptein's "travel agency" for his interstate travel to Florida to engage in prostitution with young girls. In United States v. Roberts , 174 Fed.
