As a condition of that plea, and in exchange for the Federal Government not prosecuting Defendant for numerous federal offenses, Defendant additionally entered into an agreement with the Federal Government which provides, in relevant part: Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of an offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an

For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining evidentiary burdens if any a Plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.

In Count I - Cause of Action Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Plaintiff alleges as follows: In late May or early June of 2002, Plaintiff was brought to Defendant's residence by her female 3 EFTA_R1_00170932 EFTA01810111 Case 9:08-cv-80811-KAM Document 168 Entered on FLSD Doc

   > t's battery on Plaintiff, she has suffered and will continue to suffer severe and permanent traumatic injuries, including mental, psychological and emotional damages. Compl. 204. Defendant argues in his motion to dismiss that Counts I - XXX of the Complaint, causes of action pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, must be dismissed because Plaintiff can seek damages under this statute only one time per victim, not per incident. Defendant also argues that Counts I - XXX should be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(bX6) because Plaintiff has failed to allege a violation of the requisite predicate act as identified in 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Lastly, Defendant contends that Count XXXI, sexual battery, should be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action because (1) Plaintiff has failed to allege

Discussion Counts I - XXX - Cause of Action Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4 2255 Counts I-XXX allege causes of action pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255 against Defendant Epstein. Compl. 111-199. The parties devote a great deal of attention to the issue of whether Plaintiff can recover damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 per violation or only one time per victim regardless of the number of violations. However, as the Court stated in a previous Order in this case, Tissues regarding the minimum amount of damages available to Plaintiff under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 do not affect whether Plaintiff has stated a claim and are not appropriate for a motion to dismiss. These damages issues will be resolved at summary judgment or trial." See DE 101, entered May 29,
