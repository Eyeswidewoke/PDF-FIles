   > miss those charges improperly asks the Court to adjudicate her guilt. It is for the jury to decide whether the defendant committed perjury, and the motion should be denied. Sixth, the crimes in the indictment should be tried together, as all six counts of the indictment are logically connected and provable through overlapping evidence. The Court should not sever this case, and thereby require victims of child sexual abuse to testify at multiple trials. Seventh, the Indictment indisputably alleges each element of every offense charged and provides the defendant with ample notice of the charges against her. Eighth, the Indictment is properly pled and there is no basis to strike any portion of it as surplusage. Ninth, the defense motion to dismiss one of the conspiracy charges as multiplici

   > bind other districts, Russo, 801 F.2d at 626, the defendant has failed to do so here. The defendant's motion is replete with bare assertions and conclusory allegations, but it fails to point to any evidence that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY. The lone document the defendant offers in support of her motion is a privilege log filed by the USAO-SDFL in connection with a lawsuit filed by Epstein's victims. (Def. Mot. 1 at 22). The log reflects that the FBI agents working with the USAO-SDFL interviewed witnesses in other states—including New York—during their investigation. That is entirely unremarkable, since federal investigations frequently involve gathering evidence in other states. This does not in any way establish the substantive involvement of any other districts in the prior investiga

Oosterbaan responded to Lourie that he was "not thrilled" about the NPA; described Epstein's conduct as unusually "egregious," particularly because of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was "pretty advantageous for the defendant and not all that helpful to the victims." He opined, however, that the Assistant Attorney General would not and should not consider or address the NPA "other than to say that she agrees with it." During her OPR interview, [Assistant Attorney General] Fisher did not recall reading Starr's letter or discussing it with Oosterbaan, but believed the comment about her "agree[ing] with it" referred to a federal prosecution of Epstein,

First, the non-prosecution agreement between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida is entirely irrelevant to this case, and the defendant's motion fails as a matter of law. Second, the indictment is timely under 18 U.S.C. § 3283, which provides an extended statute of limitations for crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors. The defendant's statute of limitations arguments run contrary to the text of the statute, the intent of Congress, and the weight of authority. Third, the defendant's claim that the Government delayed in bringing the indictment fails as a matter of law and fact. Fourth, both of the defendant's motions to suppress evidence obtained through a judicially approved subpoena are meritless, and her

Count One of the Indictment charges the defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.

"That knowledge," the Court explained, "goes directly to the truth or falsity of the alleged defamation, a key element of Plaintiff's claim." (Id.). The Court therefore ordered the defendant to answer the questions related to her sexual activity with or involving (1) Epstein, (2) (3) underage girls known to Epstein or who she thought might become known to Epstein, or (4) involving massage with individuals the defendant "knew to be, or believed might be, known to Epstein." (Id. at 10). The Court further ordered the defendant to answer questions about her knowledge of the sexual activities of others in the same four categories. The Court added that the "scope of Defendant's answers

(Id. at 245:7-18). counsel asked whether any minors worked as exercise instructors or masseuses at Epstein's home, and the defendant testified that they were all adults except for M, who she acknowledged at least claimed to have been seventeen. (Id. at 246:18-251:12). counsel then asked questions about whether Epstein had a "sexual preference for underage minors," which drew objections from 123 EFTA00103148 defense counsel and which the defendant ultimately answered by saying "I cannot tell you what Jeffrey's story is. I'm not able to." (Id. at 251:13-253:12). This colloquy followed: Q. Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls to use them for purposes of sexual massages? MR.
