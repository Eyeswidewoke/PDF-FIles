Pursuant to these directions and the ethical requirements of the legal profession to zealously represent my clients, I have attempted to efficiently and effectively pursue my clients' claims against Mr. Epstein. Perhaps your client thought that he could victimize and intimidate countless underage girls, that he would then agree to provide minimal compensation to them for the damage he inflicted upon them and that I would then simply let them come in and "sign the paperwork" for the absolute minimum recovery.

You shocked me with that position on November 21" and promised to get back to me to discuss it. Since we met in November, we haven't received a response regarding this issue. You apparently have finally abandoned this position. In addition, at that November meeting, I told you that some victims have severe psychological problems and that their claims warranted far in excess of $150,000 but that we are sensitive to concerns about them using the money otherwise. As a result, we discussed putting the money in special trusts expressly restricted for payment of psychological treatment. Again, I have received no response.

My February 13, 2009 letter to you was an attempt to ensure that the portion of the Agreement concerning restitution be carried out as intended and written. Indeed, our objections to your expanded role in representing the alleged victims and to Mr. Epstein's obligations to pay fees incurred outside of the settlement context are valid. Furthermore, nowhere in the Agreement or Addendum does it state that a fee dispute or contentions as to the exact role of the attorney representative constitute a breach of that Agreement. In fact, there is a requirement that fee disputes he resolved with a special master. As I further explain
