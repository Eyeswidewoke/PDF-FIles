   > My bottom lines are: (1) We currently have a potentially viable action against the New York property, albeit with significant litigation risk. The team is exploring a potentially viable action against the VI property, but it will take additional investigative work. We do not have viable action against the Florida property absent further evidence. (2) A resolution with the Estate involving a victim compensation fund outside the forfeiture process would be most likely to fully compensate victims. (3) It is possible that even absent such a resolution, the victims would be better served by litigating directly against the Estate rather than our pursuing a forfeiture.

We have not yet had a chance to fully debrief her, nor has she yet committed to being willing to testify.

And, of course, we have the results of the VI search warrant executed this week, the evidentiary value of which is presently unknown. o As with the NY property, we would need to more thoroughly investigate whether the offenses against this victim (and any others we may be able to identify) could have been discovered by a reasonable investigation between the start of the Florida investigation and 2014. o The case would require the cooperation and testimony of the victim, who has not yet committed to testify. • Florida: The only trafficking offenses that involved the Florida property for which we have evidence and venue are those invo
