   > miss those charges improperly asks the Court to adjudicate her guilt. It is for the jury to decide whether the defendant committed perjury, and the motion should be denied. Sixth, the crimes in the indictment should be tried together, as all six counts of the indictment are logically connected and provable through overlapping evidence. The Court should not sever this case, and thereby require victims of child sexual abuse to testify at multiple trials. Seventh, the Indictment indisputably alleges each element of every offense charged and provides the defendant with ample notice of the charges against her. Eighth, the Indictment is properly pled and there is no basis to strike any portion of it as surplusage. Ninth, the defense motion to dismiss one of the conspiracy charges as multiplici

The defendant's motion is replete with bare assertions and conclusoiy allegations, but it fails to point to any evidence that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY. The lone document the defendant offers in support of her motion is a privilege log filed by the USAO-SDFL in connection with a lawsuit filed by Epstein's victims. (Def. Mot. I at 22). The log reflects that the FBI agents working with the USAO-SDFL interviewed witnesses in other states—including New York—during their investigation. That is entirely unremarkable, since federal investigations frequently involve gathering evidence in other states. This does not in any way establish the substantive involvement of any other districts in the prior investiga

First, the non-prosecution agreement between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida is entirely irrelevant to this case, and the defendant's motion fails as a matter of law. Second, the indictment is timely under 18 U.S.C. § 3283, which provides an extended statute of limitations for crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors. The defendant's statute of limitations arguments run contrary to the text of the statute, the intent of Congress, and the weight of authority. Third, the defendant's claim that the Government delayed in bringingthe indictment fails as a matterof law and fact.
