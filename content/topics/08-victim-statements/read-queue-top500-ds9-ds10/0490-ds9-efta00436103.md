   > school? Isn't that unlawful given the housing guidelines for sex offenders? According to the NYPost, Epstein's Level 3 designation means that he is at "high risk" to repeat his offense and poses "a threat to public safety." When I rang Vance (twice) to discuss Epstein's residential guidelines he did not take my calls. EFTA00436103 According to a few of the attorneys who represented Epstein's victims in the civil cases, the financier never agreed to a psychological evaluation prior to or during his sentence, a requirement of all sexual predators. While Epstein's self-incriminating statements are published (this week he told the Post "the crime that was supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York" -- an interesting choice of words -- he continues to mock the law that appli

As the police records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could "say no" at any time during a massage as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in every victim's statement: First she would be asked to remove her shirt, then her pants. He would attempt to fondle her buttocks and breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator.

Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years Epstein's live-in partner, also recruited young girls. Since his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.

   > posedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York" -- an interesting choice of words -- he continues to mock the law that applies to all other sex offenders who are found guilty of the same crime. Epstein served 13 months in the West Palm Beach Stockade and 18 months under community control (a rather permissive version of house arrest), for 2 Counts of Solicitation of Prostitution with a Minor. In August of 2010, immediately following his release from "community control", Epstein returned to his $50 million East 71st Street town house given to him by his former client and long time friend Leslie Wexner. Just in the last few weeks he held a house warming dinner to celebrate his release from jail and reportedly invited television reporters Katie Couric, Charlie Rose, George Stephanop

   > e training.) Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and "deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money." (Which would amount to trafficking.) Brunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He lives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, Miami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owne

Watch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis During Epstein's term of "house arrest," he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor-13 months in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform "massages" at his Palm Beach mansion.

Epstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe http://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork The Justice Department is investigating Jeffrey Epstein for child trafficking, The Daily Beast has learned— and has widened the scope of its probe to include a famous modeling agency. Hedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last week. But it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that: • Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein's activities, to see whether there is evidence of child trafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the arrangement between Epstein and the Department of Justice allowing him to plead guilty to lower-leve

(Even when Scott opened them on his end he had no highlights) Forwarded message --------- From: Scott Denett Date: Sun, Apr 3, 2011 at 10:04 AM Subject: raw text To: M=< According to Friday's NY Post Jeffrey Epstein returned to New York City "making wisecracks about his just- ended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl". "I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 'offender,' " the Wall Street hedge fund manager told The Post. "It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel," said Epstein. Well that's not exactly the correct analogy... Not only are Epstein's comments brazen, they are arrogant and self-implicating. By telling a reporter "I'm an offender", he seems to be admitting guilt.

   > l predator case. The two most disturbing parts of this story are that this could easily happen again and that once again there will be no justice. Had Epstein been a caring benefactor contributing to society and these young girl's education and well being then the world would have judged him differently. What he has done instead is the exact opposite -- causing enormous damage to hundreds of underage girls who could have been sponsored towards a better education. With respect to Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, I'm confused by his decision to allow this sexual predator to live at his Fifth Avenue house all this time (since August 2010), given his rather tough stance on gun control as witnessed by his testimony in Friday's NYPost when asked about a Florida driver cleared in a Manhattan weapon's

A former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein's private jets. It's true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily several times—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of the contact, particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this case— judging by arrangements at the Palm Beach house-is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organ

Also: • Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein's "special treatment" and gave The Daily Beast an exclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation. • Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have landed Epstein in prison for 20 years. • Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former Soviet republics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift. • The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be evidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was convicted of. • Epstein's attorneys investigated memb
