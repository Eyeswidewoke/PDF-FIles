Based on my training and experience, I believe that prospective location information from the Target Cellphone will allow law enforcement to monitor DENNIS's current whereabouts, to assist in locating him to be arrested. It will also allow law enforcement to determine if and when DENNIS returns to the United States, and whether DENNIS presently poses a danger to the physical safety of the victims and their families. 15. Based upon the foregoing, I respectfully submit that the Requested Information will assist law enforcement with, among other things, determining the current location of DENNIS, who is a "person to be arrested" within the meaning of Rule 41(c)(4) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

As set forth above, see Paragraphs 9-12, DENNIS is known to have engaged in a long-term and pervasive campaign of harassment, intimidation, and threats directed at the victims of the Subject Offenses. There is also reason to believe that DENNIS is capable of resorting to physical intimidation and threats. See, e.g., Paragraph 12. Accordingly, alerting DENNIS to the existence and scope of this investigation may lead him to endanger the life or physical safety of others. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2705(b)(1), (4).
