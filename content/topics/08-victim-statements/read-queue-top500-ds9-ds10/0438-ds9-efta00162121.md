   > and with the intention, at least in part, to benefit JP Morgan. III. INTRODUCTION 19. Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture operated in many respects as a sex-themed cult designed to ensnare vulnerable young women and indoctrinate them into Epstein's carefully constructed world in which Epstein was their messiah. Epstein and his co-conspirators preached the gospel of Epstein. Epstein's victims were taught to do what he said, and he would protect them; but disobey him, and he would punish them; and continue to disobey, and he would cause them serious harm from which they could never recover. 20. Once in Epstein's clutches, each victim was taught and understood that she must be completely compliant with every demand Epstein had for her; otherwise, 6 EFTA00162126 Case 1:22-cv-10

And his venture provided financial and other benefits to those who assisted and enabled the venture. 22. The Epstein sex-trafficking venture was well-structured from the beginning and grew increasingly more complex and powerful as it victimized more young women and as its relationship with Defendant JP Morgan grew. 23. Epstein could not and did not act alone. He created and maintained his sex-trafficking venture with the assistance of other influential individuals and entities who knew he was sexually abusing and sexually trafficking young women and girls and provided support to facilitate his sexual abuse and sex trafficking

From the beginning of the Epstein/Staley relationship, Staley understood that Epstein's money was only a part of the incentive to protect Epstein's operation. 147. During the Palm Beach Police Department's 2005 investigation into Epstein's sexual abuse of minor children, the detectives pulled message pads left by Epstein's assistant from his trash as well as a search warrant executed at Epstein's 37 EFTA00162157 Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 36 Filed 01/13/23 Page 38 of 130 Palm Beach, Florida mansion. 148.

JP Morgan knowingly, intentionally, deliberately, and maliciously failed to do so with regard to its relationship with Epstein. 259. JP Morgan was well aware not only that Epstein had pled guilty and served prison time for engaging in sex with a minor but also that there were public allegations that his conduct was facilitated by several named co-conspirators. 260. Despite its knowledge, JP Morgan deliberately did little or nothing to inquire into or block numerous payments to named co-conspirators, and to or on behalf of numerous young women, or to inquire how Epstein was using hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in cash.

The Statute of Limitations 274. The statute of limitations under the TVPA is ten years after the cause of action arose, or ten years after the victim reaches eighteen years of age, if the victim was a minor at the time of the alleged offense. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(c)(1), (2). The TVPA causes of actions for Jane Doe 1, and the other Class Members, arose within ten years of the filing of this complaint. Epstein's sex-trafficking venture constituted a criminal conspiracy and a sex-trafficking venture that operated continuously from around 1998, through and including September 2013, and up to and follow

On or about that date, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York indicted Epstein (and unnamed "associates") for violating the TVPA. Later, on about June 29, 2020, the same Office indicted Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, for conspiracy to entice minor victims to travel to be abused by Epstein. The federal criminal investigation of Maxwell included investigation of possible 122 EFTA00162242 Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 36 Filed 01/13/23 Page 123 of 130 violations of the TVPA. 473.

For example, JP Morgan knew that Epstein was high risk—specifically, high risk to violate the TVPA through continuing criminal sex trafficking activities. 482. JP Morgan was well aware that Epstein had pleaded guilty and served prison time for engaging in sex with a minor—a crime closely connected with sex trafficking in violation of the TVPA. JP Morgan was also well aware that there were public allegations that his illegal conduct was facilitated by several named co- conspirators. But JP Morgan concealed from the federal government its numerous cash payments to those co-conspirators. JP Morgan continued its affirmative conduct of providing cash to Epstein so

JP Morgan, including its CEO Jamie Dimon and the highest levels of the bank, knew of Jes Staley's personal involvement with Epstein and yet still allowed Staley to remain a decision maker for JP Morgan on Epstein accounts. 218.

JP Morgan knew, and was in reckless disregard of the fact, that it was Epstein's pattern and practice to use the channels and instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce, to entice, recruit, solicit, harbor, provide, obtain, and transport young women and underage girls for purposes of causing commercial sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 159I(a)(1). 377.

Epstein used his wealth and power to create the Epstein Enterprise, which engaged in a pattern of criminal activity by repeatedly procuring and subjecting underage girls and young women to unlawful sexual conduct, sex trafficking, and forced labor. 29. Many of these women, particularly after Epstein's conviction in 2008, were trafficked from Eastern Europe.

Between 2005 and 2013, there were numerous press reports that Epstein sexually abused women and girls. 36. In March 2005, there were press reports that Epstein paid a 14-year old girl in Palm Beach, Florida for a "massage" and then molested her. Following these allegations, multiple underage girls, many of them high school students, told police that Epstein also hired them to give sexual massages. 37. Throughout 2006—when Epstein was arrested in Palm Beach, Florida for solicitation of a minor—there was extensive press regarding the nature and extent of Epstein's sexual offenses, including the existence of dozens of victims. 38. In 2008, Epstein pled guilty to sexual offenses i
