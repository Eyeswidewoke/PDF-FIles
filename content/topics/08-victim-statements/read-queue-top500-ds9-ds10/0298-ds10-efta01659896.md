The Office was unpersuaded by their presentation, and the investigation continued. By the late Spring and early Summer, the focus of the investigation left investigating the facts of the victims' claims and turned more to Mr. Epstein's background, his asserted defenses, co- conspirators, and possible witnesses who could corroborate the victims' statements. The 'First Assistant U.S. Attorney is sending a letter under separate cover addressing some of the items in the correspondence from you and Mr. Leflcowitz, since he has been directly involved in discussions of those issues.

On that date, the Office presented a written sheet of terms that would satisfy the Office's federal interest in the case and discussed the substance of those terms. That term sheet is attached hereto. As you will note, one of those terms was: Epstein agrees that, if any of the victims identified in the federal investigation file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida over his person and the subject matter. Epstein will not contest that the identified victims are persons who, while minors, were victims of violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections(s) 2422 and/or

I should add that there were four other prosecutors present at the meeting, representing a combined experience of more than fifty years. Never had any of them heard, or heard of, an attorney making a similar argument, and especially not in a child exploitation case. The issue of the inclusion of a restitution-type remedy for the victims pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2255 was specifically raised and discussed at the September 7th meeting, and you thanked AUSA for bringing it to your attention as a novel approach to allowing the victims to receive essentially federal restitution while allowing a plea to a state charge.

Both the federal plea agreement and the Non-Prosecution Agreement included references to Section 2255 because neither the contemplated federal charges nor the proposed state charges encompassed all of the identified victims. If Mr. Epstein had been prosecuted under the planned indictment, the identified victims would have been eligible for restitution and damages under Section 2255. As explained above, one of the United States' interests, which had to be satisfied by the Non-Prosecution Agreement, was providing appropriate compensation to the victims.

During that meeting, the issue of sex offender registration was raised, and Mr. Goldberger told the federal prosecutors that there was no problem, Mr. Epstein would plead guilty to the charge of solicitation of minors for prostitution (Fl. Stat. 796.03), which was one of the statutes listed on the original term sheet. Although our Office had wanted Mr. Epstein to plead guilty to three different offenses, we agreed to this compromise? Of course, we later learned that, at the time Mr. Goldberger made that statement, he incorrectly believed, based upon a statement from ASA that Fl. Stat. 796.03 did not requ
