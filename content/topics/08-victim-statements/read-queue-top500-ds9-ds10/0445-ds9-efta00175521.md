As Defendants have failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate otherwise, there is no need for Plaintiff to present additional evidence establishing her status as a Florida citizen. B. Plaintiff has alleged cognizable causes of action against Defendant The allegations in Plaintiff's complaint demonstrate that Plaintiff was the victim in a despicable scheme orchestrated by Defendant Epstein to find and obtain underage girls, lure them to his home, and subject them to sexual abuse or otherwise induce them to engage in lewd behavior. As much as Defendants attempt to downplay the role of Defendant by describing her as nothing but a college student with no assets, Plaintiff's complaint demonstrates that was a key player in

In her complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in which Defendant found and delivered underage girls to Defendant Epstein in order for Epstein to "solicit, induce, coerce, entice, compel or force such girls to engage in acts of prostitution and/or lewdness." (Amended Complaint ¶ 32, DE 1, p. 307). She also alleges that she was a victim of Defendants' scheme because she was one of the underage girls found and delivered to Defendant Epstein by Defendant and that she endured Epstein's actions as he tried to get her to engage in, and forced upon her, acts of prostitution and lewdness. (Amended Complaint ¶ 33, DE 1, pp. 307-308). It is for harm suffered as a result of these predicate acts that Plaintiff seeks damages for in Cou

Cf § 772.104, Fla. Stat. (listing predicate acts for Florida RICO). The plaintiff hardly establishes a RICO claim merely by reciting that she "was a victim of Defendants' scheme because she was one of the underage girls found and delivered to Defendant Epstein by Defendant and that she endured Epstein's actions as he tried to get her to engage in, and forced upon her, acts of prostitution and lewdness." (DE II at 9.) Not just in this passage, but indeed throughout her entire amended complaint, the plaintiff uses the term "scheme" as though it w

Here, Plaintiff has alleged each of the required elements in her Amended Complaint as follows: (a) a conspiracy between the three Defendants, including (Am. Compl. ¶ 21); (b) to do an unlawful act, that is, to commit the tort of sexual assault of a minor (Am. Compl. ¶ 21); (c) committed an overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy, that is, used false pretenses to lure Plaintiff to Epstein's home so that Epstein could sexually assault Plaintiff (Am.
