   > BSAO indictment was reported in the papers, and additional girls identified through those interviews. I will first address the different crimes with which Epstein can be charged, setting forth the elements of those offenses and the types of evidence that I intend to use to satisfy those elements. Second, I will summarize the evidence related to each girl who has been identified as a potential victim in this case. Following the discussion of the girls' statements and evidence, there is a discussion of the evidence from other witnesses, including corroborating evidence and information related to Epstein's background. The last section discusses forfeiture. II. The Law of the Offenses Charged Epstein's conduct violates a number of federal statutes, all of which are discussed herein. None

Third, Epstein transported in interstate commerce with the intent that engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2421. For these three offenses, knowledge of the victim's age does not need to be proven, although a reasonable belief that a person is over 18 is an affirmative defense to a limited portion of § 2423(b). In those instances where Epstein and/or the assistants knew the ages of the girls (or had reason to know their ages but willfully blinded themselves to that knowledge), they can be char ed with sex traffickin , in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a

Sections 2423(b) and 2422(6) require a minor victim, but they do not require that the defendant know that the victim is a minor. For example, in December, the Fourth Circuit issued its opinion in United States v. Jones , 471 F.3d 535 (4th Cir. 2006).

Jones argued that the term "knowingly" in that section required the Government to prove that Jones knew the age of the victim. The Fourth Circuit soundly rejected the argument, citing the other circuits reaching the same conclusion. Jones , 471 F.3d at 538-39 (citing United States v.

   > e Epstein was committing the offenses. EFTA00229862 In addition to conspiracy charges, there are five statutes related to sexual activity that have been violated. First, Epstein traveled in interstate commerce with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b). Second, Epstein and his assistants used a facility of interstate commerce to induce or entice minors to engage in prostitution and sexual activi for which any person can be charged, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b). Third, Epstein transported in interstate commerce with the intent that engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2421.

Epstein is considered an extremely high flight risk and, from information we have received, a continued danger to the community based upon his continued enticement of underage girls. For these reasons, we would like to present a sealed indictment to the Grand Jury on May 15, 2007 , and we would like the presentation of that indictment and the status of the investigation to remain confidential. The investigation initially was undertaken by the City of Palm Beach Police Department in response to a complaint received from the parents of a 14-year-old girl, "Jane Doe #

In conducting its analysis, the Jones Court relied upon cases interpreting sections of Title 21 relating to the distribution of drugs to a minor. See Jones at 540. Those cases have held that the Government must prove only that the defendant knowingly distributed the narcotics to someone who happened to be underage. While the Eleventh Circuit has not addressed the question posed by Jones , it has addressed 21 U.S.C. § 861(a)(3) and has reached the same conclusion in approving the district court's instructions to the jury: Section 845 of 21 U.S.C.A. provides that anyone who knowingly or intentionally distributes controlled substances to a person under twenty-one is subject to enhanced EFTA00229863 pen

For girls who were 16 or 17 at the time, I have charged only travel to engage in a "commercial sex act." I also have elected to treat all of these sexual massages as "commercial sex acts" regardless of whether there was any penetration. Epstein exchanged money for the opportunity to view underage girls in various states of undress and to masturbate in front of them. As described by the girls, Epstein received sexual gratification from the experience and he constantly tried to "push the envelope" to convince the girls to become more and more sexual. As . described, when a girl refused to let Epstein touch her, Epstein "down-promoted her" to become a recruiter. d. Conspiracy [Count 21

One of job responsibilities, for which she was paid handsomely, was to arrange both the ailments with the underage girls and also to arrange Epstein's travel. Epstein's pilots testified that was the person who would call them to have them at the airport alien time and who would tell them where they would be traveling to. Accordingly, I have charged alone with a single count of violating § 2423(c). f. The Affirmative Defense Regarding Knowledge of Age Section 2423(g) provides that in "a prosecution und

Congress's decision to include an affirmative defense to part of the statute shows that it has considered the issue and determined that the Government does not have to prove that the defendant EFTA00229871 knew the victims were underage for the other portions of the statute. This is consistent with the cases interpreting various sections of the Mann Act. Thus, for those instances where we know that a 16- or 17-year-old girl affirmatively told Epstein that she was 18 — and it would have been reasonable for Epstein to believe that statement — I have not charged Epstein with violating 2423(b). g.
