While I do not speak for them, it is my understanding that is the full context in which the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office intends to address the charges that involved the crime in which your daughter was victim. Please know, that it is the role and responsibility of law enforcement to investigate crime and to refer appropriate charges to the prosecutor for consideration. I believe that the Palm Beach Police Department has acted competently and responsibly in carrying out this role.

And she escorted the girls upstairs when they arrived, putting fresh sheets on a massage table and placing massage oils nearby. * Police took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses. They contend that on three occasions, Epstein had sex with the girls. A money manager for the ultra-rich, Epstein was named one of New York's most eligible bachelors in 2003 by The New York PoSt. He reportedly hobnobs with the likes of former President Clinton, former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers and Donald Trump, and has lavish homes in Manhattan, New M

Like the defendant in Hunter, the defendant argued that the anomey-client privilege precluded admission of the receipts against him at trial. Similarly, in Meredith, the defense investigator found the murder victim's wallet based on information obtained from the defendant and turned it over to defendant's attorney, who in turn, gave it to the police. - 9 - Black.

An indictment charging Epstein, 53, was unsealed Monday, charging him with one count of felony solicitation of prostitution. Palm Beach police thought there was probable cause to charge Epstein with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious molestation. Police Chief Michael Reiter was so angry with State Attorney Barry Krischer's handling of the case that he wrote a memo suggesting the county's top prosecutor disqualify himself. "I must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office's handling of this matter has taken and consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualifi

"The reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were not charged because the Palm Beach County state attorney questioned the credibility of the witnesses," Goldberger said. A county grand jury "found the allegations wholly unsubstantiated and not credible," and that's why his client was not charged with sexual activity with minors, he said. Goldberger said Epstein passed a lie detector test administered by a reputable polygraph examiner in which he said he did not know the girls were minors. Also, a search warrant served on Epstein's home found no evidence to corroborate the girls' allegations, Goldberger said.

He urged Krischer to "consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases." The police believed they had probable cause to arrest Epstein on four counts of unlawful sex acts with minors and one count of lewd and lascivious molestation. EFTA00179046 While Epstein was indicted on charges of soliciting a prostitute, the allegations in the police affidavit are more serious. Among them: - A girl who began massaging Epstein when she was 16 years old told police she became his "number one girl" and had visited his house hundreds of times. According to police, she said that when

In re Grand Jury, Ill F.3d 1066, 1073 (3d Cir. 1997)(collecting On page 38 of its Response, the government finally admits what it is looking for: evidence of sexual exploitation of minors, including surveillance camera footage, "computer printouts showing electronic messages for `appointments' with the minors; and printouts showing payments made to girls." This description readily illustrates the ease with which the subpoenas could have been appropriately particularized. The subpoenas, however, make not the slightest nod to limiting the government's search of the computers to

Such a subpoena is unreasonable and overbroad in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and Rule 17(c). • Similarly, the materials listed in 13 are fundamentally irrelevant to the government's investigation of Mr. Epstein, which is focused on allegations of sexual activity with underage girls. Neither Mr. Epstein's communications with his retained investigator, Mr. Riley (or his firm), nor any services Riley and his firm may have performed on behalf of Mr. Epstein, has any possible bearing on the government's investigation.
