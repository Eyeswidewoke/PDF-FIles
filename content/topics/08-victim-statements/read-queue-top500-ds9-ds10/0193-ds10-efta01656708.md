   > to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP's custody was provided with the opportunity to take his own life. The BOP's failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death and effectively deprived Epstein's numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP. Unless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining whether DOJ personn

These charges were based on allegations that between 2002 and 2005, Epstein paid girls as young as 14 years old hundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences. The indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash to recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein. On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States from France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center, located at 150 Park Row in New York, New York (MCC New York).

There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in administrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population presents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of the inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault, acting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff concerns about the inmate's safety.

MCC New York staff are to continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The SOP policy governing crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately attend to an apparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence over efforts to preserve a crime scene.13 S.

The indictment alleged that from at least 2002 through 2005, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom he knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds of dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates, created a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some victims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein.

In its ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking statute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The court found that the United States had shown by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the safety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of repeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were found during an

Additionally, on that date, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unsealed approximately 2,000 pages of documents in civil litigation involving Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later convicted in December 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors over the course of a decade. The documents contain substantial derogatory Information about Epstein and there is extensive media coverage of information in the unsealed documents.

H 371, 1591(a), (bX2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls, some as young as 14 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida.
