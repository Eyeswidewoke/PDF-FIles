Again, this has no applicability to the facts alleged here. The data is informative in other ways, as well. Though there are a handful of cases in which the telephone is one of a multiple of means of interstate communications allegedly used, in only two such cases, both far different from the facts here,[ was the use of the telephone the sole means of the wrongdoing alleged.

Fla. Stat. Ann. §796.07, a general statute which proscribes "prostitution" and "lewdness", regardless of whether an adult or minor is involved, is of very limited applicability here. That statute's definition of "prostitution" excludes conduct of which there may be evidence, specifically, a man masturbating himself while touching the breasts of another. Section 796.07(1Xa) defines "prostitution" as the giving or receiving of the body for sexual activity for hirc. "Sexual activity" is defined to include "the handling or f

And, of course, even if a state crime was committed, which we surely do not concede, that does not make out a federal crime, unless it could be proven that the defendant knowingly induced an illegal act over the telephone.

But even where a massage involved sexual activity with a woman under 18, to the extent Mr. Epstein did not know the woman was under 18, or the telephone call did not induce the activity, or Mr. Epstein did not intend the sexual activity at the time the telephone call arranging th

Of those cases, 115 involve the classic "Internet Sting" operations where either the government or a private organization has focused its investigative efforts on the use of the Internet to lure infants and minors, 3-14 years-old. Of those 115 cases, 71 involved the use of Internet chat rooms. As the chart reflects, the circumstances under which this statute has been applied invariably involved communications containing an explicit inducement — if not many — to the minor to engage in sex, and reflect the defendant's clear knowledge of the age of the minor.
