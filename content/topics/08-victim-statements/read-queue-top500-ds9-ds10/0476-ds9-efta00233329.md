While we are aware of his recent guilty plea and conviction in his State Court case, the sentence imposed in that case is grossly inadequate for a sexual predator of this magnitude. The information and evidence that has come to our attention in this matter leads to a grave concern that justice will not be served in this cause if Mr. Epstein is not aggressiv

He is a sexual addict that focused all of his free time on sexually abusing children, and he uses his extraordinary wealth and power to lure in poor, underprivileged little girls and then also uses his wealth to shield himself from prosecution and liability. We are very concerned for the health and welfare of the girls he has already victimized, and concerned that if justice is not properly served now and he is not imprisoned for a very long time, he will get a free pass to sexually abuse children in the future. Future abuse and victimization is obvious to anyone who really reviews the evidence in this case, and future sexual abuse of minors is inevitable unless he is prosecuted, tried and appropriately sentenced.

United States of America Case No.: 08-80736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON Dear Mr I am writing to inquire about whether Mr. Epstein has violated his Non-Prosecution Agreement with the Government. As you know, the Government has repeatedly described the Non-Prosecution Agreement as guaranteeing to the victims of Epstein's sexual abuse at least $150,000 in civil damages. The Government has made these representations in reliance on a current provision in the U.S. Code — 18 U.S.C. § 2255(a) — which provides for an automatic amount of damages of at least $150,000. At the time that the Non-Prosecution Agreement was drafted and signed, that was the law that was in effect. In Epstein's latest filing in

L. 109-248, Title VII, § 707(b), (c), July 27, 2006, 120 Stat. 650. In light of Epstein's latest filing, I write to ask several questions: (1) Would you stipulate that you told me several times that Epstein had agreed to pay at least $150,000 to the identified victims of his abuse? (2) Did Epstein in fact agree to pay damages to the identified victims of his abuse at least $150,000? (3) Did the Government tell victims, either directly or through counsel, that Epstein had agreed to pay his victims at least $150,000?

The federal non-prosecution agreement signed by Mr. Epstein and his counsel requires Mr. Epstein to plead guilty to the current state indictment and also to an information charging a state offense that requires sex offender registration, specifically the charge of procuring minors to engage in prostitution, at least 18 months imprisonment, and an agreement that the victims can pursue damages claims as though Mr. Epstein had been convicted of the federal offenses. Our agreement does not address probationary periods following the term of incarceration. Those are statutorily set on the federal side, so we have left that issue to the defense to negotiate with you. If you

The information and evidence that has come to our attention in this matter leads to a grave concern that justice will not be served in this cause if Mr. Epstein is not aggressively prosecuted and appropriately punished. Based on our investigation and knowledge of this case, it is apparent that he has sexually abused more than 100 underage girls, and the evidence against him is overwhelmingly strong. As former Assistant State Attorneys with seven years' prosecution experience, we believe that the evidence against Mr. Epstein is both credible and deep and that he may be the most dangerous sexual predator of children that our country has ever seen. The evidence suggests that for at least 4 years he was sexually abusing as many as
