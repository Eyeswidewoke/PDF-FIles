I recommended him for that job because I 21 think so highly of him. 22 Q. And in his Complaints, are you aware that 23 he's made the allegation that Defendant Epstein has 24 a sexual preference for underage minor girls?

This is not -- it's not familiar to me 18 except that what I said previously that as part of 19 the resolution of this case, Mr. Epstein agreed he 20 would not contest jurisdiction for the victims who 21 chose to sue him, et cetera, is consistent with my 22 memory, but I have no recollection of actually 23 seeing this draft, this proposed draft. 24 MR.

EDWARDS: Me, too. Thank you. 20 BY MR. EDWARDS: 21 Q. Is there any nonprivileged information 22 which would demonstrate whether 23 statement that she was flown on Jeffrey Epstein's 24 plane while underage was true or false? 25 A. I'm sure there must be, but I don't have www.phi sre orting.com EFTA00615601 481 1 it in my mind right now, so I can't answer that 2 question. 3 Q.

Under the age of 18, but the age of 14 consent in numerous places that she flew to were 17 15 and 16. So New York, the age is 17, to my 16 recollection. And in New Mexico, I think it's 17. 17 And the Virgin Islands, I think it's 16. So the 18 answer to the question is she underage might well be 19 no. 20 Q. My question was, is there nonprivileged 21 information that would indicate the truth or falsity 22 of her statement that she traveled on Jeffrey 23 Epstein's airplane with Jeffrey Epstein while under 24 the age of 18? 25 A. I do not know of any statement that she www.phi sre orting.com EFTA00615603 483 1 said -- may have said it, but I don't have in

So you 4 would have to show me. If the statement was below 5 the age of 18, that would be correct. If the 6 statement would be underage, that would be more 7 questionable. 8 Q.
