Examples could be poor coping resources, susceptibility to anxiety, an inability to occupy themselves, not being future oriented, isolated from family, impulsivity, or any number of other concerns. The prison setting is an environmental factor that impacts inmates. These include things such as uncertainty and fear, potential victimization by other inmates, isolation, poor facilities and breakdown of relationships. We all experience situational triggers that cause us to resort to old habits or in some cases to give up. These may include any of the identified factors on the slide. By communicating and interacting with staff and inmates we can frequently obtain this information. Unfortunately, these are often seen as just

Also, what the person did before they died (medications, age, etc) and conditions of the body can effect rigor. Most EMTs will not intubate when rigor has set in because they cannot get the mouth open. Hyoid bone breaks are more common in hangings with older victims because the bone is more brittle and calcified. In strangulations, would expect to see a fracture in the center of the hyoid bone because the biomechanics are pressure on both sides. In hangings, would expect to see a fracture at the end of the bone as the fracture occurs when the bone is pushed back and up against the spine, which is a stronger bone. JE's hyoid was broken at the end, which

As long as a noose can be tightened enough to stop the blood flow, and it does not take much, the inmate will slowly lose consciousness; brain cells will begin to stop functioning, and the inmate will eventually die. Significant brain damage can begin to occur in 4 to 5 minutes. This is important because even minor attempts or gestures can result in death simply because it is much easier than many people might think to die in this manner. A new trend in prison has been overdose. Because of this, the use of "pill line" is a recommendation for some high risk inmates.
