The indictment alleges that the defendant undertook this conduct at at least two locations, including his mansion in Manhattan and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. In both locations, victims were initially recruited to provide massages to the defendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including contact with the victims' genitals. These victims, who were often particularly vulnerable, were as young as 14, and the defendant knew he was abusing underage girls. The indict

So starting with the nature and seriousness of the offense, as previously discussed, the nature and circumstances of the crime are the most serious crime that this court sees. The defendant is alleged to have spent years sexually abusing minors in multiple locations and with dozens of victims. The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the potential penalties, which include up to 45 combined years of incarceration on Counts One and Two, and the likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is supported by the fact that the government's evidence is strong. There are multiple individual identified victims in the indictment, numerous specified overt acts, and dozens

This court knows that defendants are routinely detained in this district when facing such charges and that this is not an unusual position for the government to take.
