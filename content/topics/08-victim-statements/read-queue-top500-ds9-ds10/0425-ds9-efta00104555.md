A person who offers ninny to a minor to have sex with him commits a crime.

The Conduct is Not a Res:kb:rabic Offense Under Florida Law Under the Agreement. Mr. Epstein is to plead guilty to an indictment charging one count of Florida Statute § 796.07. solicitation of prostitution, and to one count of Florida Statute § 796.03. procuring a minor for prostitution. Given the commercial nature of the conduct generally associated with § 796.03. a defendant convicted under this statute must register as a sexual offender under Florida's Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (the "Florida's Sex Act"). However. Mr. Epstein's alleged conduct does not meet the requirements of § 796.03, or for that matter. any of the other Florida stat
