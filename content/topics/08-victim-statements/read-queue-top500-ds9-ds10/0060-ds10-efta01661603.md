And she escorted the girls upstairs when they arrived, putting fresh sheets on a massage table and placing massage oils nearby. • Police took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses. They contend that on three occasions, Epstein had sex with the girls. A money manager for the ultra-rich, Epstein was named one of New York's most eligible bachelors in 2003 by The New York Post. He reportedly hobnobs with the likes of former President Clinton, former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers and Donald Trump, and has lavish homes in Manhattan, New Mex

Lie detector tests are not admissible in a criminal court. However, police officers counter Epstein's lawyers claims by saying they have irrefutable evidence including sworn affidavits from five alleged victims -- some who were underaged when they allegedly had sex with Epstein -- and 17 witnesses. Jeffrey Epstein was called an international mystery money man who appeared on the news media's radar when he jetted to African on his private Boeing with Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Chris Rock. New York Magazine in 2003 stated that he was a man known to love the ladies and was very secretive about ht

In April, Epstein lawyer Guy Fronstin accepted a plea deal that would have the billionaire plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony, and would give him five years' probation but no criminal record, according to the Post. That deal was to only apply to one of the five alleged victims. Fronstin has since been fired, and a new defense attorney, Jack A. Goldberger, said that no such plea deal was made by any of Epstein's attorneys, according to the Post. Goldberger and Dershowitz could not be reached for comment Monday.

The case raised eyebrows because the state attorney's office rarely, if ever, kicks such charges to a grand jury. And it increases the difficulty of prosecuting child sex abuse cases, especially when the defendant is enormously wealthy and can hire high-priced, top-tier lawyers. At least one of Epstein's alleged victims told police he knew she was underage when the two of them got naked for massages and sexual activity. She was 16 years old at the time and said Epstein asked her questions about her high school, according to police reports. http://www.theawarenesscenter.org/Epstein_Jeffrey.html 4/25/2007 EFTA01661621 Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa...

The girl's father says he doesn't know whether she told Epstein her age. "My daughter has kept a lot of what happened from me because of sheer embarrassment," he said. "But she very much looked 14.

   > ir credibility was an issue when it decided not to charge Epstein directly, but instead give the case to the grand jury. "A prosecutor has to look at it in a much broader fashion," a state attorney's spokesman said last week. Epstein hired Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz when he became aware he was under investigation, and Dershowitz gave prosecutors information that some of the alleged victims had spoke of using alcohol and marijuana on a popular Web site, according to a Palm Beach police report. Prosecutors typically consider two things in deciding whether to charge somebody with sex-related offenses against minors — whether there is sufficient evidence and whether there is a public interest in doing so, Dekle said. If two teens are in a sexual relationship and the boy turns 18

   > interest in pursuing that, Dekle said. But where there is a large gap in ages — and especially in cases of teachers with students — there is a public interest in prosecuting, he said. Likewise if the accused has a track record of sex with minors. Still there is a "universal constant" in prosecuting these cases, Dekle said. Men who exploit underage children for sex often carefully choose their victims in ways that will minimize the risk to them, he said. Victims usually are from a lower social status, and they may suffer from psychological problems, Dekle said. "Lots of child sexual abuse victims have been victimized by multiple people over a period of time. Then the act of abuse produces behavior in the victims that further damages their credibility." Examples include promiscuous behavi
