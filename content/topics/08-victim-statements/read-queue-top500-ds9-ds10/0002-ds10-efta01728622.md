Referring to the same thing by different names and different things by the same name frequently creates con- fusion. For example the same 15-year-old individual can be referred to as a(n) "baby," "child," "youth," "juvenile," "minor," "adolescent," "adult," or (as in one forensic psychological evaluation) "underage adult." A father who coerces, a violent abductor, an acquaintance who seduces, a child-pornography collector, or an older boyfriend can all be referred to as a "child molester" or "pedophile." In written and spoken communication definitions are crucial to understand- ing. The problem is that when we use basic

If adolescents are considered child victims of sexual exploitation, then their needs, interests, and desires must be realistically recognized and understood when addressing the problem. Legal definitions of who is considered a child or minor vary from state-to- state and even statute-to-statute when dealing with adolescent victims. During a prosecution the definition can even vary from count-to-count in the same indict- ment. The age of the child may determine whether certain sexual activity is a misdemeanor or felony and what degree felony. Issues such as whether the victim consented or whether the offender was a guardian or care

The age and circum- stances under which a child can marry an adult also vary from state-to-state. To determine who is a child, investigators and prosecutors must again turn to the law. The penal code will legally define who is a child or minor. But they must still deal with their own perceptions as well as those of the jury and society as a whole. In general a child will be defined here as someone who has not yet reached his or her eighteenth birthday. One of the problems in using this broad, but sen- timentally appealing, definition of a child is that it lumps together individuals who may be more unlike than alike. In fact 16 year

Where do female child molesters fit into this typology? The answer is unknown at this time. I have not consulted on a sufficient number of cases involving female offenders to properly include.them in this typology Although certainly a minor- ity of cases, I believe that the sexual victimization of children by females is far more prevalent than most people believe. Many people view sex between an older woman and acquaintance adolescent boy not as molestation but as a "rite of passage." Furthermore sexual activity between women and young children is difficult. to identify. Females are the pri- mary caretakers in our society and ca

The preferred age bracket for the child can also vary. One pedophile might prefer boys 8 Lo 10, while another might prefer boys 6 to 12. A pedophile's age preference might not even correspond exactly with the legal definitions of a child or minor. For example a pedophile might prefer sexual partners 13 to 19. How old a child looks and acts is more important than actual chronological age. A 13-year-old child who looks and acts like a 10-year-old child could be a potential victim target for a molester preferring 8 to 10 year olds. For the introverted preferential molester, how old the child looks is more important than how old the chil

When I describe this case during a presentation, most people operating only from the intrafamilial perspective of child sexual abuse react with disgust or outrage at the notion that the offender is back in the home with the victim. Although that is of some concern to me, it is minor compared with my concern for other young female children in the com- munity where the offender now lives. Having reviewed and analyzed the offender's behavior patterns and extensive collection of child pornography and erotica, I know a greaideal about the sexual fantasies and desires of this clearly preferential sex offender. His daughter is now too old to be a preferred sexual partner, and an

Some pedophiles truly care about children and enjoy spending time with them. Child Pornography and Child Erotica Pedophiles almost always collect child pornography and/or erotica. Child pornography can be defined as the sexually explicit visual depiction of a minor including sexually explicit photographs, nega- tives, slides, magazines, movies, videotapes, or computer disks. Child erotica (pedophile paraphernalia) can be defined as any material, relating to children, that serves a sexual purpose for a given individual. Some of the more common types of child erotica include toys, games, computers, drawings, fantasy writings, diaries, souvenirs, sexual ai

Legal definitions of the term "child pornography" vary from state-to-state and under federal law. Under most definitions child pornography usually involves a visual depiction (not the written word) of a child (a minor as defined by statute) that is sexually explicit (not neces- sarily obscene unless required by state law). The federal child-pornography law (18 U.S.C.A. § 2256) defines a child or minor as someone who has not yet reached his or her eighteenth birthday.

Individuals suffering from one or more of these paraphilias can just engage in fantasy and masturbate, or they can act out their fantasies legally (e.g., with consenting adult partners or objects), or they can act out their fantasies illegally (e.g., with nonconsenting partners or underage part- ners). It is their choice. In addition not everyone committing a sex offense has a paraphilia. Their behavior patterns may be criminal, but not fit the specific diag- nostic criteria of a paraphilia.
