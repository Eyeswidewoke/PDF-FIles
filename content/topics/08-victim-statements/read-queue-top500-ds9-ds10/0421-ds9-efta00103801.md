   > he defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned from a multi-week stay abroad. Finally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past experience with this defendant—that if allowed to remain out on bail, the defendant will attempt to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger to the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight. The defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this case. EFTA00103801 Honorable Henry Pitman United States Magistrate Judge July 8, 2019

   > commit sex trafficking of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. As charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from a years-long scheme to commit and perpetuate the sexual abuse of underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2002, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in Manhattan, New York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence"). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the defendant, whic

In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the defendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with victims' genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate encounter. Moreover, the defendant

As set forth below, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is alleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years, and he now faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted evidence of his guilt. Moreover, in light of the strength of the Government's evidence and the substantial incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of flight, particularly given the defendant's exorbitant wealth; his

EFTA00103801 Honorable Henry Pitman United States Magistrate Judge July 8, 2019 Page 2 BACKGROUND A. Overview On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.

The defendant's victims were as young as 14 years old when he abused them. Many of his victims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant intentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his victims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused them. In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounte

And as discussed above, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so. Finally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage victim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls in his Manhattan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of his arrest, on July 6-7, 2019, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers discovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the mansi

While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some of the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl whose counsel has informed the Government was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken. Additionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which law enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-written labels including the following: "Young [Name] + [Name]," "Misc nudes 1," and "Girl pics n
