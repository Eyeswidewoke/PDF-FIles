Title 18, U.S.C. § 1595 provides a civil remedy for "forced labor" and "sex trafficking" violations, but stays such actions "during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in which the claimant is the victim." (A copy of § 1595 is 3 EFTA01660027 Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 38 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2008 Page 5 of 13 attached hereto as Exhibit "B"). In enacting § 1595, Congress specifically intended that the term "criminal action" would be applied extremely broadly. Accordingly, Congress took pains to ensure that courts would give it the broadest possible construction and, for that

   > unsupported argument must be rejected. The parallel stay provision in § 1595, discussed supra at 3-4, mandates, without exception, that any civil action brought under that section for violations of § 1591 (prohibiting transportation of minors for prostitution) "shall be stayed during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in which the claimant is the victim." 18 U.S.C. § 1591(bX1). Whether the § 1595 plaintiff has turned 18 does not vitiate the efficacy of this mandatory stay. An example illustrates why the stay provided in § 3509(k) has the same broad scope as the stay provided in § 1591(b)(1). As discussed above, § 3509(k) stays any civil suit for injury to a minor, arising out of the same occurrence as a pending criminal action. One type of

There would simply be no legitimate basis for Congress to differentiate between the consequences attached to violating these two sections. Thus, just as Congress mandated under § 1595(bX1) that civil discovery shall be stayed when there is an ongoing federal investigation under § 1591 (even after the victim turns 18), the identical treatment should apply under § 3509(k) to civil actions brought for the identical violation of § 2423(a). 5 EFTA01660029 Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 38 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2008 Page 7 of 13 Logic compels a rule requiring continued application of the § 3509(k) stay to a putative victim who has since turned 18.

Epstein relies exclusively on the pending Federal Criminal Action for this motion and therefore here provides additional background information relating to that action. At the USAO's request, we wish to clarify a minor issue regarding the form of a citation in Epstein's initial memorandum supporting his motion to stay. That memorandum cites to the Federal Criminal Action as "thn Grand Jury No. 07.103 (WPB)," rather than citing it simply as "Grand Jury No. 107-103 (WPB)." See Motion to Stay, at 2 (6/20/08).
