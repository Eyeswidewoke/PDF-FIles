Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to Rule 
17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. As detailed in the subpoena and Maxwell’s 
moving papers, she seeks authorization to serve a subpoena to the law firm of Boies, Schiller and 
Flexner LLP. BSF has filed a letter in opposition to the subpoena request. Additionally, the 
subpoenas applications, an opportunity to challenge them, and copies of any documents

data, or other objects.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). When the subpoena seeks the production of

The proposed subpoena makes twelve requests. Some of the requests relate to documents

set forth in the subpoena, the term “communications” encompasses “all forms of correspondence,
