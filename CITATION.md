# Citation Guide

Use citations that are specific enough for others to verify.

## Preferred citation format

- Path: exact repository-relative path
- Doc ID: if present (for example, EFTA-style IDs)
- Section/page marker: when available
- Access point: page URL or repo URL

Example:

```text
content/emails/cast-flagged/EFTA02334387.md (Doc ID: EFTA02334387), referenced via search.html
```

## For social posts and external writeups

- Include at least one direct source path per claim.
- Distinguish direct quote vs. paraphrase.
- If data may change, cite a release tag/commit hash.

## For issue reports and PRs

- Provide exact before/after paths.
- Include any affected doc IDs.
- Include reproduction steps for extraction/indexing issues.
