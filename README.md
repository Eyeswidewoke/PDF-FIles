## The Epstein Files. All of Them. Exposed.

On January 9, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed over **900,000 official documents** — containing more than **3 million pages** — from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Flight logs, financial records, depositions, FBI reports, victim statements, and communications involving some of the most powerful people on Earth.

Most people will never read them. They were released as raw, unsearchable PDFs — thousands of files buried across 12 separate datasets. That's by design.

**THE PDF FILES** is an independent, open-source project that has extracted, indexed, and cross-referenced every document in the official DOJ release. **343 million words** have been parsed. **99 key figures** are tracked across every mention. Every page is searchable. Nothing has been altered. Nothing has been hidden.

> *"Sunlight is the best disinfectant."* — U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis

## What we found

- ✈️ **Flight log connections mapped** — every Lolita Express passenger cross-referenced across all 12 datasets with date, route, and co-passenger data
- 💰 **Financial transactions traced** — wire transfers, trust structures, shell companies, and payment flows indexed from DOJ financial exhibits
- 📑 **400,000+ previously unsearchable pages surfaced** — deep sweep OCR recovered text from blank-flagged and image-only PDFs that standard extraction missed
- 🕸️ **Inner circle network reconstructed** — 99 key figures mapped by role, document frequency, and connection strength across the full corpus
