## 🤝 This is a collaboration — not a solo project

Thousands of people are independently analyzing these files. That's a lot of duplicated work.

**THE PDF FILES** is meant to be the shared foundation — one place where researchers, analysts, developers, journalists, and citizens can pool their work instead of starting from scratch alone. The extraction, indexing, and cross-referencing is done. **Now we need people to help analyze, verify, expand, and maintain it.**

If you've been digging through these documents on your own, your work belongs here. If you've found something we missed, we want to hear about it. If you can code, write, fact-check, or just read PDFs — there's a role for you.

> **We are stronger together.** One verified, cross-referenced, public-domain archive is worth more than a thousand isolated efforts.

## Collaboration roadmap

We're building toward a fully community-maintained project. Here's the plan:

| Phase | Status | What |
|-------|--------|------|
| ✅ Foundation | **Complete** | 900K+ documents extracted, indexed, and searchable |
| ✅ Analysis | **Complete** | 148 key figures profiled, investigations drafted, connections mapped |
| 🔄 Community | **Now** | Open collaboration — PRs, Issues, Discussions, contributor onboarding |
| 🔜 Organization | **Next** | Move repo to a GitHub Organization with shared maintainership |
| 🔜 Team structure | **Planned** | Roles for maintainers, reviewers, researchers, and moderators |

### Moving to a GitHub Organization

The current plan is to create a **GitHub Organization** (like `the-pdf-files` or `epstein-files-project`) and transfer this repository there. This is the standard way to run a multi-contributor open-source project on GitHub. Here's what it enables:

- **Multiple owners and maintainers** — no single point of failure
- **Team-based permissions** — separate teams for code review, content review, moderation
- **Branch protection** — require PR reviews before anything merges to `main`
- **Shared governance** — decisions made collectively, not by one person

**If you want to help maintain this project**, open an issue or reach out. We need people who can commit to reviewing PRs, moderating discussions, and maintaining quality standards.

## The Epstein Files. All of Them. Exposed.

On January 9, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed over **900,000 official documents** — containing more than **3 million pages** — from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Flight logs, financial records, depositions, FBI reports, victim statements, and communications involving some of the most powerful people on Earth.

Most people will never read them. They were released as raw, unsearchable PDFs — thousands of files buried across 12 separate datasets. That's by design.

**THE PDF FILES** is an independent, open-source project that has extracted, indexed, and cross-referenced every document in the official DOJ release. **343 million words** have been parsed. **148 key figures** are tracked across every mention. Every page is searchable. Nothing has been altered. Nothing has been hidden.

> *"Sunlight is the best disinfectant."* — U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis

## By the numbers

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| 📄 Official DOJ documents | **900,000+** |
| 📄 Total pages across all documents | **3,000,000+** |
| 📝 Words indexed | **343 million** |
| 📁 Searchable artifacts | **59,140** |
| 📦 DOJ datasets processed | **12** |
| 👤 Key figures tracked | **148** |
| 🖼️ Gallery images classified | **682** |
| ⏱️ Timeline events mapped | **51** |
| 📋 Cast profiles built | **152** |

## What we found

- ✈️ **Flight log connections mapped** — every Lolita Express passenger cross-referenced across all 12 datasets with date, route, and co-passenger data
- 💰 **Financial transactions traced** — wire transfers, trust structures, shell companies, and payment flows indexed from DOJ financial exhibits
- 📑 **400,000+ previously unsearchable pages surfaced** — deep sweep OCR recovered text from blank-flagged and image-only PDFs that standard extraction missed
- 🕸️ **Inner circle network reconstructed** — 148 key figures mapped by role, document frequency, and connection strength across the full corpus

---

## What this project is

- A fully searchable, static website indexing every document in the official DOJ Epstein release
- A cross-referenced research tool: search by name, by topic, by dataset, or across the entire corpus
- **A community project** — built to be forked, contributed to, and maintained collectively
- Built with structured content (`content/`, `data/`), 40+ Python extraction scripts, and CLIP-based image classification
- Public domain — clone it, mirror it, host it yourself

## What this project is NOT

- ❌ Not a prosecutorial finding or legal adjudication
- ❌ Not a claim that any mention in source text implies guilt or wrongdoing
- ❌ Not a complete binary mirror of every source artifact
- ❌ Not affiliated with the DOJ, any government agency, or any media outlet
- ❌ Not a one-person project — this is meant to be shared
