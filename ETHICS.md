# Ethics and Privacy

## Core principles

- Prioritize source accuracy over narrative framing.
- Minimize harm in publication and indexing choices.
- Respect survivor privacy and avoid doxxing behavior.

## Prohibited use

- Harassment
- Targeted intimidation
- Publishing private identifying information outside source/legal scope

## Sensitive content handling

- Keep contextual warnings where needed.
- Avoid unnecessary amplification of explicit or identifying material.
- Escalate accidental sensitive exposure through the process in `SECURITY.md`.

## Contributor expectations

- Separate observed facts from interpretation.
- Use neutral language in summaries.
- Flag uncertain OCR/metadata instead of forcing certainty.
