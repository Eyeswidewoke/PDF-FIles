# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve archive quality and traceability.

## Ground rules

- Keep changes source-linked and reproducible.
- Do not add speculative claims as facts.
- Preserve privacy boundaries and legal/ethical constraints.

## Best issue types

- Broken link / missing artifact
- Doc-ID mapping correction
- OCR/text extraction error
- Metadata mismatch

Use the provided issue templates when possible.

## Pull request expectations

- Keep PRs focused and small.
- Include a short "what changed and why" summary.
- Include exact file paths and doc IDs affected.
- For count-impacting changes, include before/after numbers.

## Evidence hygiene

- Cite exact source paths/doc IDs.
- Separate observed text from interpretation.
- Mark uncertain or low-confidence OCR reads explicitly.

## Style expectations

- Prefer deterministic transforms over manual edits.
- Keep filenames and paths stable when possible.
- Avoid introducing new large binaries unless required.

## Review priority

1. Data integrity and factual correctness
2. Broken references and navigation failures
3. Reproducibility and method consistency
4. UI/wording improvements
